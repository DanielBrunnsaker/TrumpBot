
Thank you, General, and hello cadets. On behalf of our entire nation, let me say congratulations to the incredible West Point Class of 2020. Congratulations. Everyone have a good time, enjoy yourselves because we are here to celebrate your achievements, and great achievements they are. Let us also recognize your remarkable Superintendent, General Darryl Williams for his outstanding stewardship. General, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Few words in the English language and few places in history have commanded as much awe and admiration as West Point. This premier military academy produces only the best of the best, the strongest of the strong, and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and great skill. There is no place on Earth I would rather be than right here with all of you. It’s a great honor.
Across this hallowed plain have passed many of the greatest and most fearsome soldiers that ever lived. They were heroes who drove thundering columns of Sherman tanks into the heart of a wicked empire. They were legends who unleashed the fury of American artillery upon our enemies on remote islands and distant shores. They were titans who strode through cannon blast and cavalry charge and stared down our foes through gray clouds of smoke and shrapnel. They were the Army Rangers who led the way up jagged cliffs, the airborne soldiers who rained down justice in the dark of night, the infantry whose very sight meant liberation was near, and the mighty forces who sent tyrants, terrorists, and sadistic monsters running scared through the gates of hell.
No evil force on Earth can match the noble power and righteous glory of the American warrior. I have no doubt that the young men and women before me today will add your names to this eternal chronicle of American heroes. You will go forth from this place adored by your countrymen, dreaded by your enemies, and respected by all throughout the world. Someday, generations of future West Point cadets will study your legacy. They will know your deeds, they will celebrate your triumphs, and they will proudly follow your example. To the 1,107 cadets who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America’s salute. Thank you for answering your nation’s call.
On this special occasion, we are delighted to be joined by Congressman Steve Womack, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, Assistant Secretary Casey Wardynski, and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville, an old grad from the class of 1981. Let’s also express our appreciation to General Curtis Buzzard, General Cindy Jebb, and all of the wonderful instructors, coaches, and faculty members who are continuing West Point’s two-century tradition of unrivaled excellence. To all of the parents, grandparents, and family members watching this ceremony from your beautiful home, even though you could not be here today, we know this day could never have happened without you. Your love and sacrifice have given America these phenomenal men and women. Cadets, please join me in sending your parents and families the heartfelt thanks that they so richly deserved. They’re all watching right now. Please. Thank you very much.
The depth and breadth of the United States military’s contributions to our society are an everlasting inspiration to us all. I want to take this opportunity to thank all members of America’s Armed Forces in every branch, active duty, National Guard, and reserve who stepped forward to help battle the invisible enemy, the new virus that came to our shores from a distant land called China. We will vanquish the virus, we will extinguish this plague. I also want to thank the men and women of our National Guard who respond with precision to so many recent challenges, from hurricanes and natural disasters, to ensuring peace, safety, and the constitutional rule of law on our streets. We thank every citizen who wears a uniform in selfless service to our nation.
The members of this class have come from every state in our union. You have come from the farms and the cities, from states big and small, and from every race, religion, color, and creed. But when you entered these grounds, you became part of one team, one family, proudly serving one great American nation. You became brothers and sisters pledging allegiance to the same timeless principles, joined together in a common mission to protect our country, to defend our people, and to carry on the traditions of freedom, equality, and liberty that so many gave their lives to secure. You exemplify the power of shared national purpose to transcend all differences and achieve true unity. Today, you graduate as one class, and you embody one noble creed, duty, honor, country. Every graduate on this field could have gone to virtually
Every graduate on this field could have gone to virtually any top rank university that you wanted, you chose to devote your life to the defense of America. You came to West Point, because you know the truth, America is the greatest country in human history. And the United States military is the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. The survival of America and the endurance of civilization itself depends on the men and women, just like each of you, depends on people who love their country with all their heart and energy and soul.
It depends on citizens who build, sustain, nurture, and defend institutions like this one. That is how societies are made and how progress is advanced. What has historically made America unique, is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment. When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring, and eternal.
It was on this soil that American Patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence. It was this school that gave us the men and women who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding. It was the graduates of West Point, towering figures like McArthur, Patton, Eisenhower, and Bradley who led America to victory over the sinister Nazis and imperial fascists 75 years ago.
It was under the leadership of West Point graduates like the legendary General Matthew Ridgway, that the army was at the forefront of ending the terrible injustice of segregation. It was army strength that held the line against brutal opposition and depression from communism. And it has been thanks to patriots like you, that America has climbed to new heights of human achievement and national endeavor. This is your history, this is the legacy that each of you inherits. It is the legacy purchased with American blood at the crest of Little Round Top, on the crimson beaches of Normandy, in the freezing mud of Bastogne and the dense jungles of Vietnam.
It is the legacy of courageous, selfless, faithful patriots, who fought for every inch of dirt, with every ounce of strength and every last scrap of heart and drive and grit they had. And they did it because they believed in the undying principles of our founding. They did it because they cherish their homes, their faith, their family, and their flag. And they did it because when they came to this school, they were taught to hold fast to their love of our country, to cherish our heritage, learn from it and build upon it.
That is what young Americans are taught here at West Point. That is the legacy that you carry forward as second lieutenants in the United States army. And you must never forget it. Through four long years, you have honed your skills, trained your mind and body, overcome every obstacle and earned your place of pride in the Long Gray Line. You made it through the rigors of R-Day and Beast and intensity of CLDT and weeks of training in the blistering heat, you have pushed yourselves far beyond every limit imaginable.
Some of you have even pushed the limits a bit too much. So for any cadets who have not finished walking off their hours, as commander in chief, I hear by absolve all cadets on restriction for minor conduct offenses, and that is effective immediately. Congratulations. That’s a nice one, isn’t it? Don’t you feel better now? Surviving the 47 month experience is never easy, but only the class of 2020 can say it survived 48 months. And when it comes to bragging rights, no one can boast louder than the class that brought Navy’s 14 year football winning streak to a screeching halt. You did that. I happened to be there.
I happened to be there. That’s right. That was a big day. I was there. You beat Navy and brought the Commander-In-Chief’s Trophy back to West Point for two straight years. So we say, "Go, Army, go." This graduating class secured more than 1000 victories for the Black Knights, including three bowl victories, 13 NCAA team appearances and a woman’s rugby championship, with the help of somebody that I just met, 2019 MVP, Sam Sullivan. Fantastic job. Thank you. Fantastic.
Five cadets won national boxing championships, and Adaya Queen brought home two. Brendan Brown, earned the title of Powerlifting National Champion. In academics, 38 cadets have earned fellowships to continue their studies, including First Captain Dane Van de Wall, who received one of the most prestigious awards in academia, the Rhodes Scholarship. Congratulations, Dane. It’s a great achievement. Thank you. Congratulations. Great achievement. But no one modeled the values of the soldiers
But no one modeled the values of the soldier-scholar quite like Lindy Mooradian. Lindy earned both the highest overall class standing and the highest physical program score. She has published scientific research in a prominent journal and set five new records on the athletic track. Lindy, incredible job. Where is Lindy? Where is Lindy? For somebody that did so well, they didn’t give you a very good seat, Lindy. We have to talk about that. Congratulations.
Right now, America needs a class of cadets that lives by your motto, "With vision, we lead." We need you to carry on the spirit of the great General Ulysses S. Grant. Soon after assuming overall command following three years of Union setbacks, General Grant encountered someone heading north to Washington during the Battle of the Wilderness. "If you see the President," Grant said, "tell him from me that whatever happens, there will never be no turning back." We need you to be as visionary as Patton, who, as a young man in 1917, became the first soldier assigned to the Army Tank Corps. One month into the job, he saw the future, writing, "If resistance is broken and the line is pierced, the tank must and will assume the role of pursuit cavalry and ride the enemy to death." Under Patton’s leadership, that’s exactly what they did.
We need you to be as bold and determined as the immortal General Douglas MacArthur, who knew that the American soldier never, ever quits. After leaving the Philippines for Australia at a low point of the Pacific War in 1942, MacArthur famously vowed, "I shall return." For two years, he then took great strategic risks and placed himself often in personal danger. On October 20th, 1944, MacArthur stepped off a landing boat, strode through knee-high water, and proclaimed, " People of the Philippines, I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil." He then called upon the island’s brave people to rise up and joined the fight. America’s momentum was unstoppable.
These great leaders were not afraid of what others might say about them. They didn’t care. They knew their duty was to protect our country. They knew the Army exists to preserve the Republic and the strong foundations upon which it stands: family, God, country, liberty, and justice. They were true, tough American Patriots. That is what our country needs, especially in these times, and that is what you are.
Each of you begins your career in the Army at a crucial moment in American history. We are restoring the fundamental principles, that the job of the American soldier is not to rebuild foreign nations, but defend and defend strongly our nation from foreign enemies. We are ending the era of endless wars. In its place is a renewed, clear-eyed focus on defending America’s vital interests. It is not the duty of US troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never even heard of. We are not the policemen of the world.
But let our enemies be on notice. If our people are threatened, we will never, ever hesitate to act, and when we fight, from now on, we will only fight to win. As MacArthur said, "In war, there is no substitute for victory."
To ensure you have the very best equipment and technology available, my administration has embarked on a colossal rebuilding of the American Armed Forces, a record like no other. After years of devastating budget cuts and a military that was totally depleted from these endless wars, we have invested over two trillion, trillion, that’s with a T, dollars in the most powerful fighting force by far on the planet Earth. We are building new ships, bombers, jet fighters, and helicopters by the hundreds, new tanks, military satellites, rockets, and missiles, even a hypersonic missile that goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile currently available in the world and can hit a target 1000 miles away within 14 inches from center point.
For the first time in 70 years, we established a new branch of the United States military, the Space Force. It’s a big deal.
In recent years, America’s warriors have made clear to all the high costs of threatening the American people. The savage ISIS caliphate has been 100% destroyed under the Trump administration and its barbaric leader, al-Baghdadi, is gone, killed, over. The world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is likewise dead. As Commander in Chief, I never forget for one instant the immense sacrifices we ask of those who wear this nation’s uniform. Already you have known the crushing pain of losing a brother in arms. Today we remember an extraordinary cadet who made the supreme sacrifice in an accident last year, CJ Morgan. We are deeply moved to be joined by his father, Chris.
Deeply moved to be joined by his father, Christopher Morgan was something very special. Christopher is a Secret Service agent, a tough guy, great guy, great son is looking down right now. Christopher, I want you to know that we will carry C.J.’s blessed memory in our hearts forever. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Tomorrow, America will celebrate a very important anniversary, the 245th birthday of the United States Army. Unrelated, going to be my birthday also. I don’t know if that happened by accident. Did that happen by accident, but it’s a great day because of that Army birthday, and as you know the Army’s first commander in chief, General George Washington, called the fort that stood on this majestic point the most important post in America. It’s strategic location on the Hudson River was vital to our war for independence. If British ships gained control of this river, they would have divided our young nation in two so American soldiers stretched a massive metal chain across the waters of the Hudson from West Point all the way to Constitution Island. I saw a piece of that chain. It’s incredible. No enemy ship even dared try to cross. Every link in that great chain was formed from over 100 pounds of pure American iron, mined from American soil, and made with American pride.
Together those links formed an unbreakable line of defense. Standing here before you more than two centuries later, it is clearer than ever that General Washington’s words still hold true. West Point is still the indispensable post for America, the vital ground that must not lose, and the survival of our nation still depends on the great chain reaching out from this place, one made not of iron, but of flesh and blood, of memory and spirit, of sheer faith and unyielding courage. Today each of you becomes another link in that unbroken chain, forged in the crucible known as the United States Military Academy, the greatest on Earth. It has given you soldiers that you could rely on to your right and to your left and now we are entrusting you with the most noble task any warrior has ever had, the privilege to carry out the task of preserving American liberty.
As long as you remain loyal, faithful and true, then our enemies don’t even stand a chance. Our rights will never be stolen. Our freedoms will never be trampled. Our destiny will never be denied and the United States of America will never be defeated. With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will stop the West Point Class of 2020 from achieving a true and lasting victory. God bless you, God bless the United States Army, and God bless America. Congratulations, thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much, please. And thank you all for being here as we take historic action to deliver a future of safety and security for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. We’re joined today by law enforcement professionals and community leaders. Though we may all come from different places and different backgrounds, we’re united by our desire to ensure peace and dignity and equality for all Americans. I’ve just concluded a meeting with incredible families, just incredible families that have been through so much. The families of Ahmaud Arbery, Botham Jean, Antwon Rose, Jemel Roberson, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Darius Tarver, Cameron Lamb and Everett Palmer.
These are incredible people, incredible people, and it’s so sad. Many of these families lost their loved ones in deadly interactions with police. To all of the hurting families I want you to know that all Americans mourn by your side, your loved ones will not have died in vain. We are one nation, we grieve together and we heal together. I can never imagine your pain or the depth of your anguish, but I can promise to fight for justice for all of our people. And I gave a commitment to all of those families today with Senator Tim Scott and Attorney General Bill Barr, we are going to pursue what we said. We will be pursuing it and we will be pursuing it strongly, Tim, right? Okay.
I want to recognize the Attorney General Bill Barr who has spent much time on this and other matters like this. Bill, thank you very much for being here along with great job you’re doing. Along with Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell and Tim Scott, and they’re going to be working on a Senate bill also that could go hand in hand with this. And also representatives Kelly Armstrong, Louie Gohmert, Jim Jordan, Guy Reschenthaler and Pete Stauber. And thanks also to Florida Attorney General, Ashley Moody. The President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Pat Yoes. President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Steven Casstevens, and many other law enforcement leaders who are going to be joining me at the signing.
Today is about pursuing common sense and fighting, fighting for a cause like we seldom get the chance to fight for, we have to find common ground. But I strongly oppose the radical and dangerous efforts to defend, dismantle and dissolve our police departments, especially now when we’ve achieved the lowest recorded crime rates in recent history. Americans know the truth, without police there is chaos, without law there is anarchy and without safety there is catastrophe. We need leaders at every level of government who have the moral clarity to state these obvious facts.
Americans believe we must support the brave men and women in blue who police our streets and keep us safe. Americans also believe we must improve accountability, increase transparency and invest more resources in police training, recruiting and community engagement. Reducing crime and raising standards are not opposite goals, they are not mutually exclusive, they work together, they all work together. That is why today I’m signing an executive order encouraging police departments nationwide to adopt the highest professional standards to serve their communities. These standards will be as high and as strong as there is on earth.
The vast majority of police officers are selfless and courageous public servants. They are great men and women. When others run away from danger police run straight into harm’s way often putting their lives at stake to protect someone who they don’t know or never even met. Great danger. Police officers run straight toward this incredible harm. Take the World Trade Center, they ran straight into the Twin Towers of 9/11. Many of them never returned, never returned. Vast numbers of New York’s finest never returned.
Last year, I presented the Medal of Valor to six heroic police officers who ended a murderer’s rampage so professionally in Dayton, Ohio. Hundreds of people would have been killed surely without them. We ask our police to put on the uniform and risk their lives for us every day. The least we deserve and the least we can do because they deserve it so much, they have to get our gratitude and we have to give them great respect for what they do for their job is one of the most dangerous jobs on earth, one of the most difficult jobs on earth.
Last year alone 89 law enforcement offices were killed in the line of duty. In recent days two members of law enforcement were killed amid riots and looting and hundreds of police offices were injured just recently. One officer was shot in the head and is now laying in a hospital almost totally paralyzed. Despite our very good record on crime, law and order must be further restored nationwide and your Federal Government is ready, willing, and able to help. As we did in Minneapolis after it got out of control for four days, we sent in representatives commonly known as the National Guard, and it was all put down very quickly. We’re willing to help, we’re willing to help in Seattle, we’re willing to help anywhere you want and we’ll be there very quickly it won’t take long.
There will be no more looting or arson and the penalty will be very grave for those who get caught. Violence and destruction will not be tolerated, we cannot do that. The looters have no cause that they’re fighting for, it’s just trouble. Every day police officers make great sacrifices to keep our community secure and safe. In 2018 our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder, 25,000 people for rape and nearly 1.5 million for assault, very dangerous criminals. In many cases local law enforcement is underfunded, understaffed and undersupported.
47% of all murders in Chicago and 68% of all murders in Baltimore went without arrests last year. Americans want law and order, they demand law and order. They may not say it, they may not be talking about it but that’s what they want. Some of them don’t even know that’s what they want but that’s what they want, and they understand that when you remove the police, you hurt those who have the least, the most. Nobody needs a strong, trustworthy police force more than those who live in distressed areas. And nobody is more opposed to the small number of bad police officers, and you have them. They’re very tiny, I use the word tiny. It’s a very small percentage, but you have them. But nobody wants to get rid of them more than the overwhelming number of really good and great police officers. Some of them are standing with me and with me in the audience today and I appreciate you being here. Thank you, thank you. Great job.
What’s needed now is not more stoking of fear and division, we need to bring law enforcement and communities closer together, not to drive them apart. Under the executive order I’m signing today we will prioritize federal grants from the Department of Justice to police departments that seek independent credentialing, certifying that they meet high standards and in fact in certain cases, the highest standard. That’s where they do it the best on the use of force and deescalation training.
For example, many believe that proper training might have prevented the tragic deaths of Antwan Rose and Botham Jean. As part of this new credentialing process chokeholds will be banned except if an officer’s life is at risk. And I will say we’ve dealt with all of the various departments and everybody said, "It’s time, we have to do it." Additionally, we’re looking at new advanced and powerful less lethal weapons to help prevent deadly interactions. New devices are being developed all the time and we’re looking at the best of them and cost is no object, no object.
Under this executive order departments will also need a share of information about credible abuses so that offers with significant issues do not simply move from one police department to the next, that’s a problem. And the heads of our police department said, "Whatever you can do about that please let us know." We’re letting you know, we’re doing a lot about it. In addition, my order will direct federal funding to support officers in dealing with homeless individuals and those who have mental illness and substance abuse problems. We will provide more resources for co-responders, such as social workers who can help officers manage these complex encounters. And this is what they’ve studied and worked on all their lives, they understand how to do it. We’re going to get the best of them put in our police departments and working with our police.
We will have reform without undermining our many great and extremely talented law enforcement officers. President Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period. The reason they didn’t try is because they had no idea how to do it, and it is a complex situation. Beyond the steps we’re taking today I am committed to working with Congress on additional measures. Congress has started already and there’ll be having bills coming out of the Senate and possibly out of the House, and hopefully they’ll all get together and they’ll come up with a solution that goes even beyond what we’re signing today. But this is a big, big step that hasn’t been taken before.
But in order to make real progress on public safety, we have to break old patterns of failure. Many of the same politicians now presenting themselves as the solution are the same ones who have failed for decades on schools, jobs, justice, and crime, they are all often. Unfortunately the same politicians running the cities and states where help is most needed. It’s an attitude and it’s not working. Today’s action is a big part of the solution to restoring, renewing and rebuilding our communities. For the last three and a half years my administration has been focused on creating opportunity, fighting for equal justice and truly delivering results. Nobody has ever delivered results like we’ve delivered, nobody’s come close.
And we work with some great people, we work with fantastic people to get it done. We enacted landmark criminal justice reform, something that nobody else could get done. They tried and they couldn’t even come close and we got it done and we got it done powerfully and people appreciated it. But it’s something that with all the work and all the talk for so many years, criminal justice reform, nobody else could get done. We secured permanent and record funding for HBCUs, that’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Numbers that they never thought were possible and long-term financing.
Because they would come back to the White House after my third year, I said, "Why are you here again?" Great people, about 42 people, the heads of black colleges and universities, great people. They do such an incredible job and I’d see them after the third year. I say, "Why are you doing this?" "We need money again." I said, "Don’t we set it so you have a 10-year program, a five-year program?" "You know, sir, for years and years we’ve had to come back every single year." I said, "Well, the only bad thing about what I’m going to do is I’m going to give you long-term financing and I’m going to up the amount, but I won’t get to see you anymore, so that’s the bad part. But you can focus on education now instead of worrying about dealing with us in Washington." So we did that for the historically black colleges and universities. I’m very proud of it, they’re incredible people. Got to know a lot of the heads of those colleges, they do an unbelievable job and don’t get the kind of notoriety that they should have.
We expanded affordable options for better healthcare. We created Opportunity Zones with Senator Tim Scott, brought it to me. We didn’t know if we could get it passed, Tim, right? But we got it passed and I think it’s probably one of the great things that we’ve done in this administration. Tens of thousands of jobs, billions and billions of dollars being brought into areas and neighborhoods that would never, ever, ever be taken care of monetarily, areas that didn’t have 25 cents put in them for years and decades. And now people are investing thriving and the jobs, they’ve come back.
We achieved the lowest black, Hispanic, and Asian unemployment rates in American history and we will do it again, we’ll do it again. We’re fighting for school choice, which really is the civil rights of all time in this country. Frankly school choice is the civil rights statement of the year, of the decade and probably beyond because all children have to have access to quality education. A child’s zip code in America should never determine their future and that’s what was happening. We’re very, very strong on school choice and I hope everybody remembers that. And it’s happening, it’s already happened, but it’s happening. We have tremendous opposition from people that know they shouldn’t be opposing it, school choice. All children deserve equal opportunity because we are all made equal by God, so true.
A great jobs market and thriving economy is probably the best thing that we can do to help the black, Hispanic, Asian communities. We saw that just recently prior to the virus that came in from China just a few months ago, what a horrible thing it was all over the world, 188 countries now. And I just want to say we’ve done incredibly well, we’re doing well. Things are happening that nobody can even believe. Our country is opening up and it’s opening up rapidly. We had the best unemployment and employment numbers, think of that. In the history of our country we’re up to almost 160 million people working, there was never anything even close. And that’s for almost every group, including black, Hispanic, Asian, women, young people, old people, young people without a high school diploma, every group.
Everybody was thrilled, everybody had just about high paying jobs. Our country was never in a better position and we were planning on massive growth, it was happening, it was already there. Including big salary increases which were already taking place for the last two and a half years. Big, big increases, record increases, nobody’s seen anything like it. And then we got hit by the virus along with the rest of the world and now I’m building it up again. Here we go again, but I’m building it up again and it’s moving fast and it will be even better than before because we also learned. It will be better than before.
Jobs are rapidly coming back and retail sales that were just announced two hours ago, just a little while ago, they’re up a staggering 17.7%. Amazing. The projection was anywhere from six to 8%, we’re up 17.7%. And what does that mean? The stock market went through the roof. These good numbers they drove it up to a level that we’re almost at the same level, hard to believe, we’re getting very close to the level we were before the pandemic and before all of the things that you’ve seen happen, happen. That’s a great thing because ultimately it’s about jobs, it’s about, the government can never do anything like a great job for a person where they look forward to getting up in the morning and going to work and getting a much bigger check than they could ever get otherwise.
Today and over the last 60 days we’ve had one of the biggest stock market increases in the history of the stock markets. And two weeks ago, the 50-day increase was the single biggest. Unless my formula is tampered with we will soon be in a stronger position than we were before the plague came in from China. When the numbers reached the point that I know they will, there will again be a great unity and a great spirit in our country. People will have that job back that they might’ve lost.
There’ll be making even more money than they did before. We have some brilliant people working with me and we put it together. We did it once and we’re very easily doing it again, we’re way ahead of schedule, you’ll see that. You’ll see the third quarter numbers will be very good. You’ll see fourth quarter will be really good and you’ll see next year will be one of the best economic years this country has ever had. And it’s all happening very quickly way ahead of schedule and I think you’ll see that people can’t even believe what they’re looking at.
But on top of all of that before the end of the year I predict we will have a very successful vaccine, therapeutic and cure. We’re making tremendous progress. I deal with these credible scientists, doctors very, very closely. I have great respect for their minds and they have come up with things and they’ve come up with many other cures and therapeutics over the years. These are the people, the best, the smartest, the most brilliant anywhere. And they’ve come up with the AIDS vaccine, they’ve come up with or the AIDS and as you know there’s various things and now various companies are involved.but the therapeutic for AIDS, AIDS was a death sentence and now people live a life with a pill, it’s an incredible thing.
The Ebola vaccine and others, these are the people that have done it, or these are the people that have been around it and they’re all competing, it’s an incredible thing. All of these brilliant firms, labs, companies are competing and I will tell you we’re very far advanced. We’ve already started tests and trials, so I think we’re going to have a very, very good answer to that very, very soon. I always say even without it, it goes away. But if we had the vaccine and we will, if we had therapeutic or cure, one thing, sort of blends into the other, it will be a fantastic day. And I think that’s going to happen and it’s going to happen very soon.
Americans can achieve anything when we work together as one national family. To go forward we must seek cooperation not confrontation. We must build upon our heritage, not tear it down. And we must cherish the principles of America’s founding as we strive to deliver safe, beautiful, elegant justice and liberty for all. I’d like now to invite our great friends, because they are a great friends from law enforcement. The officers representing their groups to come up as I sign a very important executive order. And we’re asking Mitch and Tim and all of the people that are here from Congress to go back and see if they can get something done.
I see Louie and Jim Jordan. We’re all here, a lot of our representatives in Congress and the Senate. If they can go back and add to what we’re signing today it’ll be a big moment, it will be a big moment. But this is a tremendous step. This is a step that could have been taken years ago but people chose not to do that and that was, in my opinion a big mistake. It could have solved a lot of the problems that we have now. If I could, law enforcement if you could come forward. We’ve had the please come up.
We’ve had the endorsement of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Union of Police Associations. Major County Sheriffs of America Association, National Association of Police Organizations, National District Attorneys Association, National Sheriffs Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, and many others. They’ve worked on this with me and my team and it’s been fantastic. I want to thank my team, what a team it is. And we’ve taken very much into mind what they are saying because these are the people that keep us safe and they’ve done an incredible job. Thank you all very much, Thank you.
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much, thank you.
Alex Azar, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, who by the way, was fantastic over the weekend in various interviews you did Ben. Really good job. I appreciate it. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert Wilkie, Administrator, Seema Verma, Chief Postal Inspector of the United States Postal Inspection Service, Gary Barksdale. Gary’s done a great job, especially with spotting drugs coming into our country. He’s done a fantastic job. My administration is working tirelessly to stop the depraved criminals who seek to defraud American seniors of which there are many, but we are doing a very strong number on a lot of them and nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Three months ago, we launched the National Elder Fraud Hotline, which has already received over 1,800 calls. In three years, we’ve charged nearly 1,000 defendants involving over $2.2 billion in fraud against our seniors. This afternoon, the DOJ is announcing a $2 million grant to help new law enforcement identify victims and bring lawbreakers to justice.
These actions are just one part of our unwavering devotion to our senior citizens. Last month, I announced a deal to slash out-of-pocket costs. You have the out-of-pocket costs of insulin and insulin’s such a big deal and such a big factor of importance for our senior citizens. And we slashed costs for hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries. Impacted seniors will pay just $35 a month, an average saving of 66 to 100%. It was the biggest slashing of insulin. Nobody’s ever done it before. And we think we can even go further. We’re working on one. Call it a trap because you have a lot of different traps that get put in your way so that you can’t do these things, but we did it. And we think we’re even going to be able to go further. So we have $35 a month.
We vastly expanded Medicare telehealth services. That’s gone up probably more than any other thing. That’s the only thing, it’s probably the only thing you can say about COVID. Because of COVID, telehealth has been used at levels that nobody ever thought even possible. And it’s been fantastic. And I think a lot of people are going to continue to use it. Average basic Part D premiums have dropped 13.5% and average Medicare Advantage premiums have dropped 27%. And as you know, last year was the first year where drug prices in 52 years where drug prices have actually gone down, the cost of prescription drugs. We’re strongly defending Medicare and Social Security, and we always will. We’ll always protect our senior citizens and everybody against preexisting conditions. My administration is also taking vital action to protect seniors in nursing homes. We delivered $81 million for increased inspections and provided every Medicare certified nursing home with shipments of personal protective equipment.
We are working very, very hard with the governors of the states on their nursing homes, because obviously that was a very sad situation what happened to some of the states where they didn’t do a good job with respect to nursing homes. They were caught unaware. They were caught unaware, unfortunately. So we’re working very hard with the governors and with everybody having to do with nursing homes because it’s a vulnerability. It’s a real soft spot in terms of the COVID or any one of the 15 names you want to call it. There are plenty of them out there. Well, we know it came from China. That’s all we know. We now require nursing homes to report the coronavirus cases directly to CDC, residents, and family members, all family members. We’re working with extreme vigilance to protect nursing home residents from the virus. And as I said, that’s been a very important thing for us to be doing, everybody working with the governors on that.
My administration will never waiver in our relentless commitment to keep America’s seniors safe. We have to keep all of our seniors safe, and this is a very perilous time. And I think we’re going to be finishing up. I think we’re going to, Mike has some very good numbers to tell you about having to do with the cases. Again, our testing is so far advanced. It’s so much bigger and better than any other country that we’re going to have more cases. We’re always going to have more cases. And as I said this morning, that’s probably the downside of having good testing is you find a lot of cases that other countries who don’t even test don’t have. If you don’t test, you don’t have any cases. If we stop testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any. But we do. We’re at a level that Mike is going to talk about that’s so high, but we will show more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do. They just don’t talk about it.
But the testing on the other hand is very good because we find out where it’s going, how it’s going, who it’s going to, and we take care of it. So with that, I’ll just say that we are fighting for American seniors. Like no administration has ever fought. We’re doing a great job in bringing down costs. We have other things like transparency that are going to be coming online in January, February, which will be an incredible thing. Nobody thought we could even get that approved, but we think we will see numbers there that will be incredible in terms of cost reduction for our seniors. So that’s very good. And Mike Pence, if you would please.
Nice place. Wow. I’ve been hearing about this one. Great job. Great job. Thank you very much for being here. It’s an honor and very important time in our country. A lot of things are happening and I think when it all ends up, it’s going to end up very good for everybody. It’s an honor to be at Gateway Church with the Attorney General, our great Attorney General, William Barr. And my friend, Ben Carson, who has done a fantastic job at HUD Secretary. And a young star, Jerome Adams, General. Where is Jerome? Jerome. Along with a lot of my friends out in the audience. In fact, a lot of the great political leaders from Texas I see. Some great, great friends and I want to thank you all for being here. Faith leaders, members of law enforcement, so important. We want law and order. We have to have a lot of good things, but we have to have law and order.
Got to have some strength. You have to have strength. You have to do what you have to do. And you look at a Seattle. We just came in. We just see over the screen and we’ve been hearing about it. Bill and I were talking about it. The law and order, look at what happened in Seattle. They took over a city, a city, a big city, Seattle, a chunk of it. A big chunk. Can’t happen. That couldn’t happen here I don’t think in the state of Texas. I don’t think so. I don’t think so.
So I want to thank Pastors Robert Morris and Steve Dolan. They’re great people, great people with a great reputation. I have to say that, great reputation. And Gateway Church, the team has been incredible in hosting us. And I’d now like to ask Pastor Morris and Bishop Jackson to lead us in prayer. Thank you.
at that point, it’s been an amazing thing to behold and we’re going to be starting our rallies. The first one we believe will be probably we’re just starting to call up, will be in Oklahoma, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A beautiful new venue, brand new, and they’re looking forward to it. They’ve done a great job with COVID as you know, in the state of Oklahoma. And we’re going to be coming into Florida, do a big one in Florida, a big one in Texas, they’re all going to be big. We’re going to Arizona. We’re going to North Carolina at the appropriate time. The governor’s a little backward there, he’s a little bit behind. And unfortunately we’re going to probably be having no choice but to move the Republican convention to another location. That’ll be announced shortly, but we’ll have no choice. We wanted to stay in North Carolina very badly. We love it, it’s a great state. A state I won.
Many, many friends, many relatives, frankly, that live there. And we’ll see how it all works out. But the governor doesn’t want to give an inch. And what he’s doing is losing hundreds of millions of dollars for his state, but we’ll probably have no other recourse but to move it to another state. We have a lot of states that want it, Texas, Georgia, Florida. There are many, many states that want it. But we’ve given them everything we can, North Carolina, special place. But I think we’re going to probably end up giving you an announcement pretty soon. We are doing well in so many ways. You see what’s going on with NASDAQ. We just broke another record yesterday. Some good news came out of the federal reserve today. I think some very good news. We’re really doing a financial comeback, the job’s numbers were fantastic.
Now we’ll have some other job numbers come up over the next few weeks and we’ll see how that goes. But I think it’s really good and we’re on our way to a very big comeback. I’d like to ask some of the folks that I’m with today to say a few words. They’ve been really supporters and friends of mine. They understand life. They understand I think the black community better than anybody I know. And I will tell you, Ben Carson is an example of exactly what I’m talking about. He’s been my friend from the first day we met, I think, and we met, we were opponents, but we were never really opponents. Ben is a very exceptional guy. He’s done a fantastic job at HUD, but I’d like to maybe start with Ben to say a couple of words and go to Darrell. And the rest of us, let’s say a few words to the press. So if you would please, Ben.
Well, thank you very much. This is a very big day for our country. It’s affirmation of all the work we’ve been doing, really for three and a half years. This isn’t just over the last few months. This is for three and a half years. And it’s a great thing. We were very strong. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And that strength let us get through this horrible pandemic, largely through. I think we’re doing really well. Vaccines, by the way, I had a meeting yesterday on vaccines. We’re doing incredibly well with that. I think you’re going to have some very positive surprises. And therapeutics, likewise, we’re doing extremely well. Cures, we’re doing well. I think those two words really blend in with each other, but tremendous progress is being made on vaccines.
In fact, we have ready to go in terms of transportation and logistics. We have over two million ready to go, if it checks out for safety. And it’s also, the nice part is we have four companies, I guess you could even say seven or eight companies, that are doing some similar and some very different on the vaccine front. And some similar and somewhat different on the therapeutic front. So tremendous progress is being made on that. And I think even without that, and I have to say, even without that, and I don’t think you’re going to be having to use that in the future, that statement, "Even without," because I think they’re going to have it. But we’re going to be back and we’re opening our country. And I hope that the lockdown governors, I don’t know why they continue to lock down. Because if you look at Georgia, if you look at Florida, if you look at South Carolina, if you look at so many different places that have opened up, I don’t want to name all of them, but the ones that are most energetic about opening, they are doing tremendous business.
And this is what these numbers are all about. And you have to remember one other thing. Very importantly, I think it’s extremely important for you to remember that many of our states are closed or almost closed. Some of the big ones, New York, New Jersey. They’ll start. They’re starting now to get open. I hope. And I hope that you also use our National Guard. Call me. We’ll be ready for them so fast their heads will spin. We did it in Minnesota, in Minneapolis. We were incredible. They were ripping that place apart. I love it. We had such success there. And they were ripping it apart. And I called the governor and the National Guard went in. In one night it was over. You don’t see the problem in Minnesota now at all. Not even a little bit. You take a look at a great city.
It just great, great city, Minneapolis. And it was under siege like nobody’s ever seen. Where people are running from a police department, the great police, and they were told to. They didn’t want to run. They were told to. It’s bad, bad governing. And I’m not blaming the governor. I’m blaming the mayor. But we want to get all of this finished. This is a great tribute. What we’re announcing today is a tremendous tribute to equality. We’re bringing our jobs back. When we had our tremendous numbers. And when we had just prior to the China plague that floated in, we had numbers, the best in history for African American, for Hispanic American, and for Asian American and for everybody. Best for women, best for people without a diploma, young people without a diploma. I mean so many different categories. Our numbers were the best in almost every category.
We had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people. We were never even close to that. So we had things that we were doing so well and then it came in, but we’re going to be back there. I think we’re going to actually be back higher next year than ever before. And the only thing that can stop us is bad policy. Frankly, left-wing, bad policy of raising taxes, and Green New Deals and all of the things that you have been writing about long and hard that will stop it like you wouldn’t believe. And frankly, it’s holding it back. If there were no possibility that that can happen, and I like to be an optimistic person, I think we’re looking very good. I think even before today, the polls that I’ve seen in the polls that we do were looking very good.
But if we didn’t have the possibility of having massively higher taxes, like the Democrats want to do, and Green New Deals, which are totally ridiculous. Frankly, ridiculous. And I’m a big environmentalist. I believe strongly in taking care of our environment. We have the cleanest air we’ve ever had, like over the modern era. Which let’s say you go back 30 years, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water we’ve ever had. We’re setting all sorts of really good environmental records. We’re very proud of that. But the Green New Deal would kill our country. The Green New Deal would have a devastating effect on the world. And it’s not going to happen anyway, because it’s impossible for them to do it. If you ever look at what they want to do under the Green New Deal, it’s like baby talk. But we are doing something that This was an important day because it shows that what we’ve been doing is right.
And the reason it’s been an is so good is because the body was strong. Our body were so powerful that we could actually close our country, save millions of lives, stop people very early on from China, from coming in, because we stopped early. At the end of January, very early, people coming from China who were infected, coming into our country. That was a very hard decision to make. Nobody, almost nobody wanted me to make it. I would almost say nobody wanted me to make it. But we made that decision. And even my enemy said, that was an extremely important We saved tens of thousands of lives with that decision. So we did a lot of things. And then we really ended up with empty cupboards. We went into a ventilator period that the likes of which nobody’s seen since the second World War, we mobilized. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.
And then we did test, we’re over 20 million or very close, but I think we’re over 20 million tests. More than anybody in the world. Germany is at about four. And South Korea is at three and a half. We’re over 20. And by the way, when you do more testing, you have more cases. We have more cases than anybody because we do more testing than anybody. It’s pretty simple. But this is outstanding what’s happened today. Now, they thought the number would be a loss of nine million jobs. And it was a gain of almost three million jobs. Nobody’s ever seen anything. I think it was incredible in a couple of ways. Number one, the numbers are great. And this leads us onto a long period of growth. We’ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we’re going to have a very good upcoming few months.
I think you’re going to have a very good August, very good July, but a spectacular Maybe spectacular September. But a spectacular October, November, December, and next year is going to be one of the best years we’ve ever had economically. And if you look at the numbers, they bear it out. But we were strong. It’s sort of like when you go in for an operation, if a person is healthy, healthy, we were healthy. We had the greatest economy in the world. We went in for an operation. We closed our country down. We closed it down. We saved possibly two million, two and a half million lives. Now, it could have been a million lives. I don’t think anything less than that. But if you think we’re at 105 million today, the 105,000 today, that would mean at the lowest number, it would be 10 times that amount. And I think everybody believes the least If we went herd, as they say.
And if you look at Brazil, they’re having a very hard time. And by the way, they kept bringing up Sweden. It’s come back to haunt Sweden. Sweden’s having a terrible time. If we did that, we would have lost a million, a million and a half, maybe even two and a half million or more lives. So we’re at 105,000 lives. Big move, closing it up. We also closed it up to Europe. Europe became very infected from China. A gift from China. Not good. They should have stopped it. They should’ve stopped it at the source. But it’s a gift from China and a very bad gift. I will tell you that. And you do say how come at Wuhan, where it started, and they were very badly They were in bad trouble. But it didn’t go to any other parts.
It didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. Then you say, "How come it came out to Europe, to the world, to the United States?" So it didn’t go to China. They stopped it cold. They knew it was a problem. But they didn’t stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Somebody has to ask these questions. And we’ll get down to the answer. We made a great trade deal. Great. They’re going to buy $250 billion worth of product. And by the way, they are online, they’re doing okay. But the ink wasn’t dry on that deal when the plague floated in. What’s going on? A plague is floating in from China. What’s going on? So the ink wasn’t dry. So I guess I viewed the trade deal a little bit differently than I did three months ago.
It’s a great deal. I will say they are buying a lot from us. And in that way, I respect. And getting along with China would be a good thing. I don’t know if that’s going to happen. I’ll let you know. We’ll let you know. I think they want to get along very much with us. But we built a tremendous thing, a tremendous power platform. So when it got ill, when we had a problem, we were able to cut it off, stop it, just like this. Stop it. Keep everyone inside, keep them away, keep them together, away, uninfected. And we saved millions of lives. And now we’re opening and we’re opening with a bang. And we’ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship. This is far better than a V. A V is wonderful. A V is this. They were talking about, will it be a V, a U, an L? They had no idea.
And I was watching one of the shows, and I have great respect for the people. And they said, "Will it be nine million in job losses? What will the number be? Are they going to report record numbers? Will we break 20%? What will the number be?" And I don’t know, because we were in, and I don’t think we’re in that territory anymore. We were in unchartered territory. Nobody’s ever had a situation like that. So the number was nine million, and one of the people was going, "No, no. I think it’s going to be 10 million." That’s 10 million negative, losses. And then somebody else said, "No, we think it’s going to be 8.7, 9.2." Everyone was right around that number. This is Great geniuses. And they are. I watch them all the time. And oftentimes they’re right.
Warren Buffet sold airlines a little while ago. He’s been right his whole life. But sometimes even somebody like Warren Buffet, I have a lot of respect for him. They make mistakes. They should have kept the airline stocks, because the airline stocks went through the roof today. And others did too. The whole market went through the roof. But they said nine million, nine million job losses, nine million. It’s what it’s going to be. Are we going to break 20%? Are we going to break it? And then the numbers came in and one of the folks that was reading the numbers said, "Wow, this is a great number. It’s only three million job losses." And then reading it and say, "I don’t think I’m not reading this right. Let me look at it again. Wait a minute. This is three million gain almost." Three million jobs gained. And then they shouted out, one of them, sort of semi shouted out. "Is this a typo?" I think it was probably the greatest miscalculation in the history of business shows.
In the history of business shows talking about Wall Street. And that’s okay. But one of the reasons we’re in this position is because we had such a strong foundation. So we were able to close our country, save millions of lives, open, and now the trajectory is great. Don’t forget. New York is barely included. And that’s one of our big ones. California is barely included, because they’re not open. And they should open. By the way, the mayor of Los Angeles wants to keep this thing closed for a long time. Look at what’s going on in Florida. It’s incredible. The job the governor of Florida has done. It’s incredible. The numbers they’re doing, you’ve got to open it up. And you do social distancing and you wear masks if you want.
And you do things, you can do a lot of things. You’re getting closer together. Even you. I notice you’re starting to get much closer together. It looks much better, I must say. You’re not all the way there yet, but you’ll be there soon. But it’s a tremendous thing that happened. And the reason it happened is because we had a really strong patient. We had a patient that was so powerful, so strong, that we could close it and open. And I give it this analogy. Somebody told me yesterday, it was Larry Kudlow.
He said, "Sir, this is like a hurricane." And we were worried. We didn’t know, is this going to be a hurricane or a major, major recession? A major recession that’s not artificially caused, because this was artificially closed. We just said, "Boom. Closed." And everything just stopped. And also, you know what else stopped? Big numbers on death, by doing it. And that’s why I had to do it. We’ve made every decision correctly. But, it was like we stopped. So it was an artificial-
Correctly. But it was like we stopped. So it was an artificial closing. And then what happened very incredibly is the numbers go. And Larry was saying that with a hurricane, you have a horrible hurricane in Florida or Texas, and it’s devastating. And then the hurricane goes away and within two hours, everyone’s rebuilding and fixing and cleaning and cutting their grass. I’ve seen it in Texas. I’ve seen it everywhere. I’ve seen it everywhere. Texas had a massive one, Louisiana, hurricanes, Florida hurricanes. But what happens is right after the hurricane, boom, and this is what this is, this isn’t a terrible recession. I don’t even mention the D word. I don’t talk about the D word, I don’t want to talk about it, because every time somebody even mentions it, I don’t like the D word. But if you had a really, really big, bad recession, it could take 10, 12. How long did it take in 1929? It took many years to recover from that. How long?
10? I heard 10, I think, longer than 10, but that’s okay. I heard 14, 15 years. Larry says 10, so let’s go with 10. But it takes a long time to recover, but a hurricane you’re back in business in one day, two days, three days, and it’s devastating and it’s hard. And this was a hurricane. And it’s going to get better fast because a lot of the numbers that you see, they’re early numbers. They’re not even from this last month.
And by the way, speaking of that, you had the greatest 50 day rally in the history of our exchanges, the greatest 50 day rally. And we have a lot of protestors and we have something else. We have something else. We have a pandemic, we’ve made tremendous progress really on both if you look at where we’ve come on, both, we’ve made tremendous progress on both, tremendous progress. But you’re looking and the people are now starting to return to work.
So it’s been an incredible thing to see. It’s been a beautiful thing to see. The experts predicted that the economy would lose tremendous numbers of jobs, and of course from the beginning, it has, but you’re going to see how fast that’s made up. I’m telling you next year, unless something happens, where the wrong people get in here, this can turn around, your 401ks will go down to numbers. If people didn’t get rid of stocks and their 401Ks, they’re almost even, think of it. With a pandemic, and with one of the worst things that’s ever happened, our country has never lost 105,000 people. Whether it’s world trade center, which was 2,900 or Pearl Harbor, which was less than that, we’ve never lost anything close to this, but it’s not only our country, it’s the whole world. The world is suffering so badly, 186 countries at this moment. And that affects us too.
But we’re a positive force. We are the key to the world in a sense, and the fact that we’re doing well, I see already, they’re starting to do much better in other parts of the world. That’s a great thing because we’re working with the world and we’ll work with China too. We’ll work with everybody. But what happened should have never happened.
So we had a tremendous morning, a tremendous announcement. It was shocking to even great pros. I watched Maria Bartiromo, I watched Jim Kramer, I watched a lot of people, Joe Kiernan. He was pretty positive. Charles Payne, he was very positive for a long time. A lot of people got it right. They had confidence in me. They had confidence in this team and they got it right. I think that’s the only thing they could base it on because we were an unchartered territory.
I like to just say that renewal, restoration or recovery of the most vulnerable areas of America is going to be my focus, it’s going to be a big focus because it’s taking care of itself, but we have to help that very vulnerable area, the vulnerable. It’s not right. And we’re helping them, and we have helped them in the past. They were all sent to opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, nobody’s ever done for the black community what president Trump has done. Think of it. Historically, black, small colleges and universities, they would come here for money every year, every year for many, many years. After three years, I said, "Why are you doing this? Why do you keep coming here?" They said, "Because we come," I said, "Don’t you get a longterm deal so you don’t have to come?"
The head of one of the very respected colleges looked at me and said, "Sir, we’re like beggars. Every year we have to come to Washington and beg for money." I said, "You should have a longterm deal." And we signed a longterm deal so they don’t have to come. I’ll miss them, I told them I miss them, I got to know them. But the first year, I didn’t think anything of it, the second year I said, "That’s strange. Why you here?" And then the third year, not so long ago, same people, the heads of the historically black, small colleges and universities, 44 people, maybe a little more than that. Little less than that sometimes. But after three years I said, "What are you doing?" They said, "The past administration did nothing for us. The administration before that did nothing for them." So I’m going to do it.
So we did the opportunities zones with Senator Tim Scott. It has been fantastic. And by the way, it’s one of the great unknowns, because the opportunity zones you don’t talk about, it’s one of the most incredible stories ever in terms of the inner cities and in terms of black and Hispanic and Asian unemployment opportunities, as you ought to do some stories about opportunity zones. Billions and billions of dollars of private money is being invested in putting people to work and getting money that they’ve never made before.
So it’s been a really a terrific thing. It’s now time for us to work together as we rebuild, renew and recover the great promise of America, and that’s true, we’re going to work together. It’ll all work out. It’ll all work out. Some governors may need a little help yet, but I think for the most part, they are in good shape.
We have a fantastic military. We have fantastic national guard. National guard was barely used and these people have done an unbelievable job. They helped the secret service at Washington. Secret service by the way, are unbelievable. The job they did at the white house is unbelievable. There was never any form of like, "Oh gee, this sounds dangerous." All I could see is what I was seeing on television. But they were outside. And the secret service was incredible, but we were also helped by the DC police and we were helped by the national guard was unbelievable. They came in and they This was like a piece of cake.
And I really am suggesting because if you look at Minnesota and the great success we had there, and other places, I’m suggesting to some of these governors that are too proud in New York, you see what’s going on there. Don’t be proud, get the job done. You’ll end up looking much better in the end. Call in the national guard, call me. We’ll have so many people, more people than you have to dominate the streets. You can’t let what’s happening happen. It’s called dominate the streets. You can’t let that happen in New York where they’re breaking into stores and all of the things. And by the way, hurting many small businesses, you can’t let it happen.
Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed, they have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week. We can’t let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, "This is a great thing that’s happening for our country." This is a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality. It’s really what our constitution requires and it’s what our country is all about.
I just want to finish by saying, to save the economy, we passed several pieces of critical legislation, totally many trillions of dollars meaning three. We’re set up to do more if we want. I think we should, because we are dominant. For many years as a bystander, but somebody that loved government, somebody that loved this country, I would watch and study and see, when I say study, naturally study by watching. But if you go back, China was going to catch us in 2019. And that was like a given. You go back five years, six years, seven years, it was always, yeah, China will catch America, catch the United States in 2019, and then it will become the dominant economy. Never happened. It’s not going to happen.
We dominated them over the last year and a half, two years, we took in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs that they paid for. I gave some of that money, just a small fraction to our farmers, which made them whole, more than whole. That’s why they’re all in business, made them more than whole. And it came right out of the tariff money. And the reason we didn’t pay is because China devalued their currency and they paid. Plus they also put additional money to it, because if they didn’t do that, nobody would have bought that product. We made a great deal because of that. That’s the only reason we’re able to make a good deal, because of the possibility of tariffs, because China’s taking tremendous advantage of the United States. We helped rebuild China. We gave them $500 billion a year. How stupid, how stupid are the people that represented our country with China and many other countries? But that’s all changing. And it was in the process of changing very big. Again, China had a very bad year before the plague and now I think hopefully, they’re going to have a great year. I want them to have a great year, but we’re going to have better years than they ever had. We have a better system, much better system.
We made Americans sure. Of themselves and we took care of families, we gave benefits and we set $1200 to every individual making less than $75,000 and $4,000 almost to every family of four earning less than 150,000. That’s a lot, isn’t it? When you think 150, but that’s what’s happening with our country. If you look at other countries, even countries that you think they’re doing well, they don’t talk about 150,000 as being median. $150,000, that’s tremendous. That’s a great tribute to the people of our country.
The job surge that we’re seeing right now is widespread. Leisure and hospitality added 1.2 million jobs. Construction jobs are up, listen to this, 464,000. Education and health services road is 424,000. Retail trade is up 368,000. And here is the one I liked the best, remember previous administration that you need a magic wand for manufacturing. Manufacturing, which we had up to 600,000 jobs, prior to the plague manufacturing rose to 225,000 jobs, up by. So we picked up 225,000 manufacturing jobs. That’s very unexpected.
Everything that you’ve seen this morning is unexpected. Even the pros sitting here would understand that, everything. We also smashed expectations on the unemployment rate. The prediction was that the unemployment rate would rise to over 20%, and instead of drop to around a little more than 13%, slight difference. And this time the greatest come back in American history today is probably if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history, but it’s not going to stop here. It’s going to keep going because so many places are closed.
I was watching a great vice-president today being interviewed on CNBC, he did a phenomenal job and he, he made a statement. He said, "This is not going to stop," and a hundred percent, he’s always attributing everything to me, but I’ll attribute this statement to him. He said, "It’s not going to stop because the numbers that you’re looking at don’t include all of those States that are closed, they haven’t even opened yet." We’re going to be stronger than we were when we were riding high. And our stock market is almost, it’s just short of an all time high.
I’ve had 144 all time, high stock markets during a three and a half year period. Nobody’s ever come close to that and we’re going to do it again, but it’s going to be even stronger than last time.
When I would say that to you, two, three months ago, I could see what’s happened. I have a good feeling, I’ve always done well with numbers, but I had a feel for it. I said it even the other day, I was saying, "I think we’re going to have a tremendous next year. I think it’s going to be a phenomenal next year." I didn’t know it would start this quickly. I thought we’d start in August, September, but it started very early. It’s an amazing thing, but it means that they’re likely to return and all of these jobs that we’re talking about
to return. And all of these jobs that we’re talking about now aren’t even included, because some of our biggest places aren’t opened. They’re opening up now. I think New York’s opening up as of today, and that’s one of our big ones. New Jersey. They’re all working hard, the governors are all working hard. To save millions of American lives, we took that unnecessary evil  we took it out of the equation. We had to do what we did. We had a very, very strong push not to do anything. We would have lost so many people. But very importantly, the economy wouldn’t have been as good as it is, because nobody expected this. I don’t think there’s anybody sitting here that can say, I want to see it on tape, as opposed to just saying, "Oh, I did that." But some were predicting pretty good numbers, like people I mentioned. But we took a tremendous step and a tremendous risk, and we’ve gone up at a level. And this level is going to be nothing compared to what you see in coming months, and especially next year.
So the best strategy to ensure the health of our people moving forward is to focus our resources on protecting high-risk populations, like the elderly and those in nursing homes, while allowing younger and healthier Americans to get back to work immediately. And open up our schools, open them up. We understand this disease now. We didn’t understand it. Nobody’s ever seen it before. It’s very tough, very contagious. We’ve learned a lot we didn’t know. Nobody knew anything about it, but we learned a-
take care of our vets. We got choice-approved for the vets. So instead of waiting in line for four weeks to see a doctor, they can go immediately outside, get a private doctor, we pay for the bill, and the vet is in great shape. We actually save money, but more importantly, we save their lives, and we save the quality of their life. They were dying. They would come onto a line, they’d have to wait four or five weeks, they wouldn’t be very sick. By the time they see the doctor, they’d be terminally ill. We don’t have that anymore. You don’t hear any bad stories about the vets anymore. That doesn’t mean go out and find them, because tonight you’ll be traveling all over the world looking for an unhappy event.
And we got accountability, because we had a lot of bad people in the VA. It’s called VA Accountability, where we can now fire people that don’t treat our vets good. We have sadists, we have thieves, we have a lot of bad people. And we can now  it’s called VA Accountability. Almost 50 years, they’ve been trying to get it. Choice, almost 50 years, they’ve been trying to get it. For many, many years. I’ve been hearing about it for years. They’ve been trying to get VA choice. Choice means you can have a choice of a doctor. You don’t have to wait in line if you have a long line. I have to say, the VA has great doctors, but you can’t get to them very quickly. Now they go outside and they take care of themselves.
So we’ve had a great morning. This is just the beginning. It’s going to be incredible. I’m going to sign our very important piece of legislation. Again, thank you very much to the Democrats. And then we’re going to have a couple of words by a few of the people standing alongside of me. I want to thank them so much. And we’ll talk to you soon.
Thank you very much. My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the American people. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protestors to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities and as their president, I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa and others.
A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York, viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen the dreams utterly destroyed. New York’s finest have been hit in the face with bricks, brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun here in the nation’s Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial have been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set a blaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protest, these are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God.
America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, healing not hatred, justice not chaos. This is our and we will succeed 100% we will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available, federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your second amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the national guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets, mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.
If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great Capitol Washington DC. What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We are putting everybody on warning our seven o’clock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threatened innocent life and property will be arrested, detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.
This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law, we have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you, we will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life, but where there is no law, there is no opportunity, where there is no justice there is no Liberty, where there is no safety there is no future. We must never give in to anger or hatred if malice or violence rains, then none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country by far our greatest days lie ahead. Thank you very much and now I’m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much.
I want to thank our great Vice President for your fearless and tireless commitment to fulfilling America’s destiny in space. Thank you very much, Mike. Great job. Great job. We’re all so grateful to Mike’s wonderful wife, Karen, for being here and for all she does for our country. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. Before going further on this exciting day for all America in space, I want to say a few words about the situation in Minnesota. The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief. Yesterday, I spoke to George’s family and expressed the sorrow of our entire nation for their loss. I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the mission at hand.
The police officers involved in this incident have been fired from their jobs. One officer has already been arrested and charged with murder. State and federal authorities are carrying out an investigation to see what further charges may be warranted, including against sadly, the other three. In addition, my administration has opened a civil rights investigation and I have asked the Attorney General and the Justice Department to expedite it. I understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas, but what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace. The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.
The main victims of this horrible, horrible situations are the citizens who live in these once lovely communities. The mobs are devastating the life’s work of good people and destroying their dream. Right now, America needs creation, not destruction, cooperation, not contempt, security, not anarchy and there will be no anarchy. Civilization must be cherished, defended, and protected. The voices of law abiding citizens must be heard and heard very loudly. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities. We must defend the rights of every citizen to live without violence, prejudice, or fear. We support the overwhelming majority of police officers who are incredible in every way and devoted public servants. They keep our city safe, protect our communities from gangs and drugs and risk their own lives for us every day.
No one is more upset than fellow law enforcement offices by this small handful who failed to abide by their oath to serve and protect. My administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold. It does not serve the interest of justice or any citizen of any race, color, or creed for the government to give into anarchy, abandoned police precincts, or allow communities to be burned to the ground, won’t happen. Those making excuses or justifications for violence are not helping the downtrodden, but delivering new anguish and new pain. From day one of my administration, we’ve made it a top priority to build up distressed communities and revitalize our crumbling inner cities. We fought hard with Senator Tim Scott ___ and many others to create opportunity zones, helping to draw a surge of new investment to the places in our country that need it most.
We must all work together as a society to expand opportunity and to create a future of greater dignity and promise for all of our people. We must forge a partnership with community leaders, local law enforcement and the faith community to restore hope. Radical left criminals, thugs, and others all throughout our country and throughout the world, will not be allowed to set communities ablaze. We won’t let it happen. It harms those who have the least, and we will be protecting those who have the least. The leadership of the National Guard and the Department of Justice are now in close communication with state and city officials in Minnesota and we’re coordinating our efforts with local law enforcement all across our nation. In America, justice is never achieved at the hands of an angry mob. I will not allow angry mobs to dominate, won’t happen. It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of American democracy, the rule of law and our independent system of justice.
Every citizen in every community has the right to be safe in their workplace, safe in their homes and safe in our city streets. This is the sacred right of all Americans that I am totally determined to defend and will defend. My administration will always stand against violence, mayhem and disorder. We will stand with the family of George Floyd, with the peaceful protestors and with every law abiding citizen who wants decency, civility, safety, and security. We are working toward a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down.
But that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fests, standing in solidarity, not surrendering to hostility. Moments ago as we went and just the launch of two great American astronauts into space, we were filled with the sense of pride and unity that brings us together as Americans. That same spirit, which powered our astronauts to the moon has also helped lift our country to ever greater heights of justice and opportunity throughout our history. So today, as we mark a renewed commitment to America’s future in space, a tremendous commitment it is. Let us also commit to a brighter future for all of our citizens right here on earth. When Americans are united, there is nothing we cannot do. From day one of my administration, we put America first.
This afternoon, I am delighted to be with you at Cape Canaveral in this storied home of American daring aspiration and drive. This is the first big space message in 50 years, think of that, and it is an honor to be delivering it. Today as we gather in this special place to celebrate not only the launch of a new spacecraft, but also our Nation’s bold and triumphant return to the stars, it’s a special day. Moments ago, the world bore witness to the flight of the first new manned U.S. spacecraft in nearly 40 years since the space shuttle launched in 1981, a long time ago. I am thrilled to announce that the SpaceX Dragon capsule has successfully reached low earth orbit and that our astronauts are safe and sound. With this launch, the decades of last years and little action are officially over. A new age of American ambition has now begun. Past leaders put the United States at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore. Today, we once again, proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world from right here on American soil.
Those of us who saw the spectacular and unforgettable liftoff this afternoon watched more than an act of history. We watched an act of heroism. Every time our astronauts climb aboard a rocket, which is many, many stories of only engine and fuel and vault across the sky, they display breathtaking valor. What Colonel Douglas Hurley and Colonel Robert Behnken did this afternoon was pure American genius and courage. They joined the ranks of just seven prior American astronauts who have made the perilous maiden voyage to test a new class of spacecraft. The names of Hurley and Behnken will stand in the history books alongside those of legends like Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Young. Now these brave and selfless astronauts will continue their mission to advance the cause of human knowledge as they proceed to the International Space Station before returning to Earth. We wish them Godspeed on their journey and as one proud nation, we salute their fearless service. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I also want to send our Nation’s gratitude to the wives of these valiant astronauts, both of whom are astronauts themselves, Karen Nyberg and Megan McArthur. We join them in praying for our heroes safe return. As you know, this spring, our nation has endured the pain and hardship of a global pandemic. As we usher in a new era of manned spacecraft, we are reminded that America is always in the process of transcending great challenges. Our Nation is blessed with limitless reserves of talent, tenacity, and resolve. The same spirit of American determination that sends our people into space, will conquer this disease on Earth. It should have never happened. Nothing, not even gravity itself can hold Americans down or keep America back. We are grateful to NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine and Director of Kennedy Space Center, Bob Cabana, for welcoming us this evening. Very special. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Great job.
Come a long way in three and a half years, Jim haven’t we? A long way. To the incredible men and women of NASA from here at Kennedy Space Center to the Johnson Space Center in Texas, we love you too, to NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio, thank you all for working so hard to make this day a reality. We have many other great days almost ready to happen. Also with us are many members of my cabinet, including our great new DNI, John Radcliffe. Thank you, John. Thank you. We have a great friend of mine, special man ran a great, great campaign, Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Ron. Your senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio. Thank you very much. Thank you. Leader Kevin McCarthy, Kevin, thank you very much. Great job you do Kevin. And representatives, Matt Gaetz, John Rutherford, Michael Waltz, Bill Posey, Gus Bilirakis, Daniel Webster, Brian Mast, Elise Stefanik, Bill Flores, Brian Babin, Rodney Davis, Roger Marshall and Steven Palazzo. Thank you very much. Thank you.
What a great group of people. They’re warriors, they’re really warriors. They helped so much get this done and so many other things. With us also-
With us also, is our Air Force Chief Of Staff General David Goldfein. General, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, General. Thank you. And Chief of Space Operation, the first ever named, and now a member of the joint chiefs of staff, because we created the United States Space Force. General Jay Raymond. Thank you very much, Jay. Thank you, Jay.
And senior members also of our great United States military, has never been stronger than it is right now. Also Attorney General of Florida, Ashley Moody, and Chief Financial Officer of Florida, Jimmy Patronis and many other distinguished guests. Thank you very much for being here, we appreciate it. I especially want to congratulate someone who truly embodies the American ethos, a big thinking and risk taking. After achieving success as an internet entrepreneur, he could’ve spent his fortune doing anything, including yachting, lots of things, he could do lots of things. But in 2002, he began pouring tens of millions of dollars of his own money into research and development for a new rocket. He’s a little different than a lot of other people. He liked rockets. He assembled a crew of some of the greatest minds and talent in American aerospace. In the years since SpaceX has become the first private company to develop and successfully launch its own rocket into orbit. The first to launch and recover its own capsule. And of course, moments ago, SpaceX became the first private company to put humans into orbit around the earth. Elon Musk, congratulations. Congratulations, Elon. Thanks Elon. For Elon and 8,000 SpaceX employees, today is the fulfillment of a dream almost two decades in the making. For years on end, they have worked hand in hand with NASA, sculpting aluminum, tightening valves, tuning nozzles, testing parachutes, and filling massive tanks with thousands and thousands of pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen. Today, the groundbreaking partnership between NASA and SpaceX has given our nation the gift of an unmatched power, a state of the art spaceship to put our astronauts into orbit at a fraction of the cost of the Space Shuttle and it’s much better. From now on the United States will leverage the fast growing capabilities of our commercial sector and the finest pieces of real estate on Earth, which you need very badly, to send U.S. astronauts into space. Under NASA’s commercial crew program, we will use rockets and spacecraft designed, built, owned, and launched by private American companies at a fixed price for the American taxpayer. Today’s launch makes clear the commercial space industry is the future. The modern world was built by risk takers and renegade fierce competitors, skilled craftsmens, captains of industry who pursued opportunities no one else saw and envisioned what no one else could ever think of seeing. The United States will harness the unrivaled creativity and speed of our private sector to stride even further into the unknown. This launch also marks an exciting turning point for NASA. This agency will now focus its unmatched expertise like nobody’s ever seen and power and integrity to do what NASA does better than anyone else and it’s not even close. Embark on the most difficult, most daring, most audacious missions in the history of humankind. When I first came into office three and a half years ago, NASA had lost its way and the excitement, energy and ambition as almost everybody in this room knows, was gone. There was grass growing through the cracks of your concrete runways, not a pretty sight, not a pretty sight at all.
The last administration presided over the closing of the Space Shuttle and almost all of the giant facility that keeps so many people working, so many brilliant minds going. People were crying, they were devastated, but now it’s the greatest of its kind anywhere in the world and we’ll get greater and greater with years to come. I promise you that. We have created the envy of the world and will soon be landing on Mars. And we’ll soon have the greatest weapons ever imagined in history. I’ve already seen designs and even I can’t believe it. The United States has regained our place of prestige as the world leader. As has often been stated, you can’t be number one on Earth, if you are number two in space. And we are not going to be number two anywhere. Nowhere is this more true than with our military, which we have completely rebuilt. Under my administration, we have invested two and a half trillion dollars in new planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets, anything you can think of. And last year I signed the law, creating the sixth branch of that already very famous United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.
For every citizen who has eagerly waited for America to reignite those engines of will, confidence and imagination that put a man on the moon, I stand before you to say you need wait no longer. Through NASA’s Artemis program, the United States is preparing for a crude mission to Mars. Earlier this week, I saw the Orion capsules being worked on in this building as part of the Artemis Moon to Mars program. Those capsules will soon return Americans-
Those capsules will soon return Americans to lunar orbit for the first time in over 50 years, half a century. By 2024, our astronauts will return to the lunar surface to establish a permanent presence and the launching pad to Mars. And the first woman on the moon will be an American woman, and the first nation to land on Mars will be the United States of America.
Since I signed the order to establish these goals shortly after taking office, we have made rapid gains. A new 22,000 pound capsule is already built. The next generation of spacesuits are already made. Colossal rockets are now being tested, and the contracts for three separate lunar landers have been awarded and signed, and they are magnificent. In the years ahead, America will go bigger, bolder, further, faster, and America will go first. America will always be first. To be certain, we will meet the adversity and hardship along the way. There may even be tragedy because that is the danger of space. There’s nothing we can do about that. The power that we’re talking about is unrivaled. It’s nothing we can do about problems, but we’ll have very few of them. We will confront all of those challenges, knowing that the quest for understanding is the oldest and deepest hope in our souls.
The innate human desire to explore and innovate is what propels the engines of progress and the march of civilization. We will preserve and persevere, and we will ensure a future of American dominance in space. To that end, over the last three years, I reestablished the National Space Council. I issued a directive cutting red tape for innovative space companies, such as SpaceX. We created the world’s first comprehensive space traffic management system. Last month, I signed an executive order establishing U.S. policy for the recovery and use of space resources and minerals. Administrator Bridenstine announced the Artemis Accords to govern the future of space exploration development. Together, we will assert America’s rightful heritage as the greatest spacefaring nation on the planet. And already it’s not even close. In the half a century since the United States stopped sending astronauts to deep into space, 1972, no other country has ever done it.
The reasons are simple: cost, technological complexity, and tremendous danger. For instance, I was told that the rocket you just witnessed had to be launched within one second, or it would be impossible for it to hit its target. And I was here two days ago, and I said to Jim, "Jim, it’s okay, why don’t you wait five or 10 minutes?" And he said, "Sir, we only have a window of one second." And I walked out of here, shaking my head. "Is that true, Jim?" "Yes, it’s true." Space travel is not a feat of engineering alone. It’s also a moral endeavor, a measure of a nation’s vision, its willpower, its place in the world.
Exploration is a test of our values and of our faith. America is a nation defined by its commitment to discovery, to solve mysteries, to chart the unknown, to press the limits, to achieve the fullest expression of life’s potential and to ensure that America is the nation that always leads the way and especially in space. This evening, I am more confident than ever before that America stands poised to thrive in this grand undertaking. It’s incredible. We are a nation of pioneers. We are the people who crossed the ocean, carved out a foothold on a vast continent, settled a great wilderness, and then set our eyes upon the stars. This is our history and this is our destiny.
Now, like our ancestors before us, we are venturing out to explore a new magnificent frontier. It’s called space. Our most daring feats, our most epic journeys, our biggest adventures, and our finest days are just beginning. America’s proudest moments are still ahead. We are on the verge of our most exciting years, and next year may be the most exciting of all, you just watch. So today as our brave American astronauts shake the earth and blaze a trail of fire and steel into the heavens, we proclaim for all to hear that we have not yet tested the full strength of the American character, and the world has not yet seen the full glory of the American spirit. For our country, for our children, and for humanity’s march into the stars, the best is yet to come.
It was a great honor for me to deliver this speech. God bless our brave astronauts now soaring through the heavens. God bless the men and women of NASA and God bless America. Thank you very much.President Donald Trump: (00:07)
Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you. I’m here today to talk about our relationship with China and several new measures to protect American security and prosperity. China’s pattern of misconduct is well known. For decades, they’ve ripped off the United States, like no one has ever done before. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year were lost dealing with China, especially over the years during the prior administration. China raided our factories, off shored our jobs, gutted our industries, stole our intellectual property and violated their commitments under the World Trade Organization.
To make matters worse, they are considered a developing nation, getting all sorts of benefits that others, including the United States are not entitled to. But I have never solely blamed China for this. They were able to get away with a theft, like no one was able to get away with before because of past politicians and frankly, past presidents.
But unlike those who came before, my administration negotiated and fought for what was right. It’s called fair and reciprocal treatment. China has also unlawfully claimed territory in the Pacific Ocean, threatening freedom of navigation and international trade. And they broke their word to the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong. The United States wants an open and constructive relationship with China, but achieving that relationship requires us to vigorously defend our national interests.
The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts can not be overlooked or swept aside. The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government. China’s coverup of the Wu Han virus allowed the disease to spread all over the world, instigating a global pandemic that has cost more than 100,000 American lives and over a million lives worldwide. Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the world health organization to mislead the world When the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities.
Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe. They strongly recommended against me doing the early ban from China, but I did it anyway, and was proven to be 100% correct. China has total control over the World Health Organization, despite only paying $40 million per year, compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year.
We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act. Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs. The world needs answers from China on the virus. We must have transparency. Why is it that China shut off infected people from Wuhan, to all other parts of China? It went nowhere else. It didn’t go to Beijing. It went nowhere else, but they allowed them to freely travel throughout the world, including Europe and the United States.
The death and destruction caused by this is incalculable. We must have answers not only for us, but for the rest of the world. This pandemic has underscored the crucial importance of building up America’s economic independence, reassuring our critical supply chains and protecting America’s scientific and technological advances. For years, the government of China has conducted elicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets of which there are many. Today I will issue a proclamation to better secure our nation’s vital university research and to suspend the entry of certain foreign nationals from China, who we have identified as potential security risks.
I am also taking action to protect the integrity of America’s financial system, by far the best in the world. I am instructing my presidential working group, One Financial Markets, to study the differing practices of Chinese companies listed on the US financial markets, with the goal of protecting American investors. Investment firms should not be subjecting their clients to the hidden and undue risks associated with financing Chinese companies that do not play by the same rules.
Americans are entitled to fairness and transparency. Several of the most significant actions we’re taking pertain to deeply troubling situations unfolding in Hong Kong. This week, China unilaterally impose control over Hong Kong security. This was a plain violation of Beijing’s treaty obligations with the United Kingdom in the Declaration of 1984 and explicit provisions of Hong Kong’s basic law. It has 27 years to go. The Chinese government’s move against Hong Kong is the latest in a series of measures that are diminishing the city’s longstanding and very proud status. This is a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China, and indeed the people of the world.
China claims it is protecting national security, but the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society. Beijing’s decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of China’s invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of Liberty. China’s latest incursion, along with other recent developments that degraded the territory’s freedoms, makes clear that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to warrant the special treatment that we have afforded the territory since the handover.
China has replaced its promise formula of one country, two systems, with one country, one system. Therefore, I am directing my administration to begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment. My announcement today will affect the full range of agreements we have with Hong Kong, from our extradition treaty to our export controls on dual use technologies and more, with few exceptions. We will be revising the state department’s travel advisory for Hong Kong to reflect the increased danger of surveillance and punishment by the Chinese state security apparatus.
We will take action to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China. The United States will also take necessary steps to sanction PRC and Hong Kong officials directly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy and just, if you take a look, smothering, absolutely smothering Hong Kong’s freedom. Our actions will be strong, our actions will be meaningful.
More than two decades ago on a rainy night in 1997, British soldiers lowered the Union flag and Chinese soldiers raised the Chinese flag in Hong Kong. The people of Hong Kong felt simultaneously proud of their Chinese heritage and their unique Hong Kong identity. The people of Hong Kong hoped that in the years and decades to come, China would increasingly come to resemble it’s most radiant and dynamic city. The rest of the world was electrified by a sense of optimism that Hong Kong was a glimpse into China’s future, not that Hong Kong would grow into a reflection of China’s past. In every decision, I will continue to proudly defend and protect the workers, families, and citizens of the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
it’s not good. A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States, and we know what they are. We don’t have to name them. We’re going to give you a complete listing. We’re going to give you a signed copy of what I’m going to be signing in a couple of minutes, and you’ll see exactly what we’re doing. They’ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter, virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences. There’s no precedent in American history for a so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction, and that includes individual people controlling vast amounts of territory, and we can’t allow that to happen, especially, when they go about doing what they’re doing, because they’re doing things incorrectly. They have points of view, and if we go by that, it’s actually amazing that there was a success in 2016, but we can’t let this continue to happen.
It’s very, very unfair, and you look at the statistics, and you look at what is going on, and I think everybody would very much agree with that, including Democrats, by the way, I saw quite a few Democrats are saying, this is about time something is done. Let’s see if they keep that decision after they hear that we agree with them. The choices that Twitter makes, what it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple. They’re editorial decisions In those moments Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint, and I think we can say that about others also, whether you’re looking at Google, whether you’re looking at Facebook, and perhaps others. One egregious example is when they try to silence views that they disagree with by selectively applying a fact check, F-A-C-T fact check. What they choose to fact check, and what they choose to ignore, or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group or political activism, and it’s inappropriate.
You look at what’s happened, you look at where they’re going, where they’re coming from. I think you all see it yourselves. This censorship and bias is a threat to freedom itself. Imagine if your phone company silenced, or edited your conversation. Social media companies have vastly more power and more reach than any phone company in the United States. More reach actually then your newspapers by far, more reach than a lot of your traditional forms of communication. Therefore, today I’m signing an executive order to protect and uphold the free speech and rights of the American people. Currently social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they’re a neutral platform, which they’re not, not an editor with a viewpoint. My executive order calls for new regulations under section 230 of the communications decency act to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring, or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield.
That’s a big deal, and they have a shield. They can do what they want. They have a shield. They’re not going to have that shield. My executive order further instructs the federal trade commission, FTC to prohibit social media companies from engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce. This authority resides in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. I think you know it pretty well. Most of you know it very well. I would think you know it quite well, right? Additionally, I’m directing the attorney general to work cooperatively with the states. He’s going to be working very much and very closely in cooperation with the states to enforce their own laws against such deceptive business practices. The states have brought in powerful authority to regulate in this arena, and they’ll be doing it also, and we encourage them to do it. If they see exactly as we’ve been seeing, what they’re doing is tantamount to monopoly.
You can say it’s tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can’t let it happen. Otherwise, we’re not going to have a democracy. We’re not going to have anything to do with a Republic. Finally, I’m directing my administration to develop policies and procedures to ensure taxpayer dollars are not going in any social media company that repress free speech. The government spends billions of dollars on giving them money. They’re rich enough, so we’re going to be doing none of it or very little of it. As President, I’ll not allow the American people to be bullied by these giant corporations. Many people have wanted this to be done by presidents for a long time, and now we’re doing it, and I’m sure they’ll be doing a lawsuit. And I’m also sure that we’re going to be going for legislation in addition to this, and the legislation will start immediately.
I tell you, I’ve been called by Democrats that want to do this, and so, I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation, but we’re fed up with it, and it’s unfair, and it’s been very unfair, and we’ll see what happens. Any questions?
Well, if you weren’t fake, I would not even think about I would do that in a heartbeat, but the news is fake. If you look at what gets printed in newspapers, if only the public could understand where they’re reading a story, and they think it’s real, and it’s not real in so many cases, and I’m not saying in every case. You have some great journalists, you have some journalists that I have great respect for, but largely I find at least in a political sense, there’s so much fake news, it’s disgraceful.
I would do that in a heartbeat. If I had fair If we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat. There’s nothing I’d rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account, but I’m able to get to, I guess, 186 million people. When you add up all the different accounts and add Facebook and Instagram, it’s a lot of people. And that’s more than the media companies have frankly, by a lot. And so if I get a story that’s wrong, I can put a social media, I don’t usually use the word Twitter, I say social media. But I put something out and the next day or the next hour or the next minute everybody’s reading about it. So I’m able to refute fake news and that’s very important. I’d like to ask the attorney general please, to say a couple of words.
And he’s very strongly behind it, backing it very powerfully. And again, we’re going to be doing this. We’re also going through Congress.
Thank you.
I stand before you at this noble fortress of American liberty to pay tribute to the immortal souls who fought and died to keep us free.
Earlier today, the First Lady and I laid a wreath in their sacred honor at Arlington National Cemetery. Now we come together to salute the flag. They gave their lives to so boldly and brilliantly defend. And we pledge in their cherish memories that this majestic flag will proudly fly forever.
We’re joined for today’s ceremony by Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, Congressman Andy Harris, and a number of service members and veterans of the Armed Forces.
The dignity, daring, and devotion of the American military is unrivaled anywhere in history and any place in the world.
In recent months, our nation and the world have been engaged in a new form of battle against an invisible enemy. Once more, the men and women of the United States military have answered the call to duty and raced into danger. Tens of thousands of service members and National Guardsmen are on the front lines of our war against this terrible virus, caring for patients, delivering critical supplies, and working night and day to safeguard our citizens.
As one nation, we mourn alongside every single family that has lost loved ones, including the families of our great veterans.
Together we will vanquish the virus, and America will rise from this crisis to new and even greater heights.
As our brave warriors have shown us from the nation’s earliest days, in America, we are the captains of our own fate. No obstacle, no challenge, and no threat is a match for the sheer determination of the American people. This towering spirit permeates every inch of the hollowed soil beneath our feet.
In this place more than 200 years ago, American patriots stood their ground and repelled a British invasion in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. Early on a September morning in 1814, the British fleet launched an assault on this peninsula. From the Harbor, some 30 British warships attack this stronghold. Rockets rained down, bombs burst in the air, and the deck of one ship, a gallant young American was held captive. His name was Francis Scott Key. For 25 hours, Key watched in dismay as fire crashed down upon this ground. But through torrents of rain and smoke and the den of battle, Key could make out 15 broad stripes and 15 bright stars barraged and battered but still there.
American Forces did not waiver. They did not retreat. They stared down the invasion and they held that they had to endure, the fact is they held like nobody could have held before. They held this fort. The British retreated. Independence was saved. Francis Scott Key was so inspired by the sight of our flag in the battle waged that the very grounds that he fought on became hallowed. And he wrote a poem. His ageless words became the anthem of our nation, The Star Spangled Banner.
Every time we sing our anthem, every time it’s rousing chorus swells our hearts with pride, we renew the eternal bonds of loyalty to our fallen heroes. We think of the soldiers who spend their final heroic moments on distant battlefields to keep us safe at home. We remember the young Americans who never got the chance to grow old but whose legacy will outlive us all. In every generation, these Intrepid souls kiss goodbye to their families and loved ones. They took flight in plane, set sail in ships, and marched into battle with our flag fighting for our country, defending our people.
When the cause of liberty was in jeopardy, American warriors carried that flag through ice and snow to victory at Trenton. They hoisted it up the mass of great battleships in Manila Bay. They fought through hell to raise it high atop a remote Island in the Pacific Ocean called Iwo Jima. From the Philippine Sea to Fallujah, from New Orleans to Normandy, from Saratoga to Sipan, from the Battle of Baltimore to the Battle of the Bulge, Americans gave their lives to carry that flag through piercing waves, blazing fires, sweltering deserts, and storms of bullets and shrapnel. They climbed atop enemy tanks, jumped out of burning airplanes, and leaped on live grenades. Their love was boundless. Their devotion was without limit. Their courage was beyond measure.
Army Green Beret Captain Daniel Eggers grew up in Cape Coral, Florida determined to continue his family tradition of military service. And it was a great tradition. He attended the legendary Citadel Military College in South Carolina. Soon he met a beautiful cadet, Rebecca. They fell in love, married and had two sons. In 2004, Daniel left for his second deployment in Afghanistan. On the morning of May 29th, Daniel and his team were courageously pursuing a group of deadly terrorists when he was killed by an improvised explosive device. This week is the 16th anniversary of the day that Daniel made the supreme sacrifice for our nation. He laid down his life to defeat evil and to save his fellow citizens.
At the time of his death, Daniel sons Billy and John were three and five years old. Today, they have followed in Daniel’s footsteps, both students at the Citadel planning to serve in the military. They’re amazing mom Rebecca has now served more than 23 years in the US Army. Everywhere she goes she wears Daniel’s gold star pin on the lapel of her uniform.
Colonel Rebecca Eggers and her two sons are here today, along with Daniel’s father, Bill, and mother Margot. To the entire Eggers family, your sacrifice is beyond our ability to comprehend to repay. Today, we honor Daniel’s incredible life and exceptional valor, and we promise you that we will treasure his blessed memory forever. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much, please. Thank you. Thank you.
Great family. Thank you very much.
To every gold star family here today and all across our land, our debt to you is infinite and everlasting. We stand with you today and all days to come remembering and grieving for America’s greatest heroes. In spirit and strength, in loyalty and love, in character and courage, they were larger than life itself. They were angels sent from above, and they are now rejoined with God in the glorious kingdom of Heaven.
Wherever the stars and stripes fly at our schools, our churches, town halls, firehouses, and national monuments, it is made possibly because there are extraordinary Americans who are willing to brave death so that we can live in freedom and live in peace.
In the two centuries since Francis Scott Key wrote about the stirring site of our flag in battle, countless other American Patriots have given their own testimony about the meaning of the flag.
One was World War II veteran, Jim Krebs from Sunbury, Ohio. Jim and his twin brother Jack fought side by side in General Patton’s Third Army. At the Battle of the Bulge, the twins volunteered for a dangerous mission. Together they took out four enemy tanks, two machine gun nests at a mother position that was very powerful. Loaded up with mortars, Jim’s brother Jack was mortally wounded. Jim held his dying brother in his arms, praying together as his twin passed away. Jim fought to victory and came home to build a great American life.
He married, had children, became an electrical engineer, and taught young people about war. As an old man, Jim was asked, what about the American flag and what it meant to him? Jim said, "The flag to me is as precious as the freedom that the flag stands for. It’s as precious to me as the thousands of lives that have been lost defending her. It’s that important to me. It gave me a value of life that I could have never gotten any other way. It gave me a value of my Lord, my family, my friends, loved ones, and especially my country. What more could I ask?"
Last month, Jim died peacefully at his home at the age of 94. This afternoon we are greatly honored to be joined by his grandsons, Andy and Ron. Please, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here.
Today as we remember the sacrifice of Jim’s brother Jack, we honor Jim service and we’re moved by his beautiful words. Andy and Ron, thank you for being here to remember your grandfather and his brother and what they did for us all. And most importantly, what they stood for,
From generation to generation, heroes like these have poured out their blood and sweat and heart and tears for our country. Because of them, America is strong and safe and mighty and free. Because of them, two centuries on The Star Spangled Banner still proudly waves. For as long as our flag flies in the sky above, the names of these fallen warriors will be woven into its threads. For as long as we have citizens willing to follow their example, to carry on their burden, to continue their legacy, then America’s cause will never fail and American freedom will never ever die.
Today we honor the heroes we have lost. We pray for the loved ones they left behind, and with God is our witness, we solemnly vowed to protect, preserve, and cherish this land they gave their last breath to defend and to defend so proudly. Thank you. God bless our military. God bless the memory of the fallen. God bless our gold star families, and God bless America. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you, right down the road. It’s an honor to have Bill with us. Thank you very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in Michigan. We’ve done a lot of work in Michigan. A lot of plants are opening. A lot of plants stopped We stopped them from closing and we kept your workers here in Michigan and in the United States, different places as you know, all over the United States, but it’s an honor to do.
It’s one of the reasons I’m standing here. In fact years ago, I was honored long before I ever thought of the presidential situation. I was honored in Michigan and I said, "How come you’re losing so much of your car business to Mexico and other places?" And I asked that question very innocently. It was probably 10 years ago. The man of the year, they named me man of the year in Michigan. And I said, "What’s going on in Michigan?" And we’ve stopped it. And thanks to a lot of great companies like Ford, a lot of things are happening here. And it’s why I’m so honored when Bill mentioned the plant that you’re going to be doing 2,000 and it’s also a great success, the Broncos. So that’s really, really big news. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I’m honored to stand on a factory floor operated by the incredible workers of Ford Motor Company. You really are tremendously talented people. I know it. I’m not sure everybody in the world knows it, but a lot of people do. And they’re all going to know it after this speech, but you are really talented, great people. Thank you very much for doing a great job.
We know what it takes. Few people have that ability, a few. In our nation’s war against the invisible enemy, the hardworking patriots here today answered the call to serve. You prove that the American worker is built Ford and you are built for tough, a great expression. You still use that expression, I think Bill, right? That’s a great expression.
Let’s see. Can I use it for maybe myself, built Trump tough. I don’t know. They may say that’s a takeoff. That’s no good. You can’t do that. And you’ve made really America proud and you’ve made Ford proud. And America is very proud of Ford right here at the Roseville component plant. You’re building a great medical arsenal to defeat the virus and cement America’s place as the leading manufacturer and exporter of ventilators, anywhere in the world. We’re now getting calls from other countries, many other countries, both friend and foe, believe it or not.
We get calls from foe and we want to help them out too. And we’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators. And I think we really sort of started right over here. We got a call very early on from Bill and the group, and this is incredible what’s happened and what you’ve done. With your help, not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. And as you remember, we took over empty cupboards. The cupboards were bare and we got into the business of ventilators and testing and all of these other things. Now we’ve done 14 million tests. The second country is at 3 million and less than 3 million, Germany, South Korea. And they’ve done a good job, but we’re at 14 million tests and the tests are the best of all. But on behalf of our entire nation, I want to say thank you very much.
Thank you very much for doing a great job. Driven by the love and sweat and devotion of everyone here today, we’re saving lives. We’re forging ahead. And as of this week, the beating heart of the American auto industry is back open for business. That started right away. Didn’t it? It starts right now. And you have all those supply chains coming in. They’re going to come through because if they don’t come through, just build a product right here. Okay. Because you know, that can happen too.
But we heard that. It’s a big story that we’re starting with the cars now, and it’s going to be a big success. In addition to many wonderful UAW workers, we’re joined by Secretary Ben Carson, who’s done a fantastic job. Where’s Ben? Ben is here. Thank you, Ben. Where is he? Oh, there he is. Hi Ben. Thank you, Ben. Thank you. And Amanda has done a fantastic job for Ford. Although, I’ll ask Bill about this later. I’ll just find out, I want to make sure for myself, but I know based on results, I know. CEO Jim Hackett. Jim, thank you very much. The word is yes, Jim, the word is great job. Great job.
Plant manager, Angela Weathers. Angela, thank you very much. That’s a big job. That’s a big job. You enjoy it? Yeah. Great job. Fantastic. It’s a big deal. And GE Healthcare US ana Canada president Everett Cunningham. Thank you, Everett. Thank you Everett.
Before going further, let us send our love to all of the families that have been displaced by the flooding near Midland. I spoke to your governor this morning and we’ve sent some tremendously talented people out here. We have FEMA and we have the Army Corps of engineers and they can do things that frankly nobody else can do. The Army Corps of engineers, what they do. So they’re very good at rebuilding dams that are busted or blown up or for whatever reason bad things happen. But Americans are praying for central Michigan. We’re going to take care of your problem. The governor and I had a great conversation this morning. And at the appropriate time, I’ll go and see the area that we’ll be fixing. We’re going to help you out. We signed a emergency declaration very quickly, very, very quickly. And we’re going to help you out very quickly also.
In recent months, this state and this country have faced great challenges. Here in the Detroit area, you were hit hard by the virus. Very, very hard in this area. As one people, we hold in our hearts the precious memory of every person that we have lost and we’ve lost too many. One is too many. We lost too many. It came in from China and it should have been stopped in China. They didn’t stop it. They should’ve stopped it. And as one grateful nation we proclaim God bless our healthcare workers. They’ve done an incredible job. They like warriors. They’re like warriors. I want to thank all of the nurses and doctors.
Because of the virus, Ford was forced to stop automobile production for the first time since World War Two. That’s something, but you did not despair. Your company leadership called up the White House and asked the most American of all questions, how can we help? True. I said, "That’s nice. That’s very nice." Every one of the workers in this project volunteered to take part in the greatest industrialization and mobilization project that our society has done, the American people have done in our lifetimes. The company founded by a man named Henry Ford. Good bloodlines, good blood lines. If you believe in that stuff, you get good blood. They teamed up with the company founded by Thomas Edison. That’s General Electric. That’s good stuff. That’s good stuff. And you put it all together. That they’re all looking down right now. And they’d be very proud of what they see. You began the production of 50,000 lifesaving ventilators. A number that if you go back just two months, I would say most people would say it would be impossible to believe. The media is back there. And they would have said a couple of months ago, the creation of that many ventilators would have been not a possible thing.
Every single one of these ventilators is made in the USA with American heart, American hands, and American pride. Just as your great grandparents produced more than one Model T every minute, just as your grandmothers and grandfathers produced a B24, you did the B24 bombers. I saw pictures in the back. That was quite a weapon. That was quite an incredible weapon, B24 bomber.
And just as a Ford F150 normally drives off the line every 52 seconds, you quickly mastered this complex new machine of ventilators. They’re a very complicated, delicate, big, expensive machine. One month ago, Ford had never built a single ventilator. And now you’re a world leader. That’s not bad. You adopted the designs of a company that was building just 10 a week, but a very high quality ventilator. And very soon you’ll be producing one new ventilator every single minute. It’s an absolute amazing achievement. And you’re really helping now beyond the country. You’re helping other countries throughout the world. We have 188 countries that are fighting this terrible enemy and ventilators is something they could never You could do cotton swabs. You can do all of the things, you could even do testing, but ventilators are a whole different lot. It’s very tough. Great job.
different lot. It’s very tough. Great job. Thanks to you, we’ll stockpile over 100,000 new ventilators in the next few months, and have offered over 14,000 to friends and allies all around the world, and they desperately need them. Just this week, I spoke to five countries. They called me. Is it possible to get ventilators to them, and I’m sending them over. I want to recognize just a few of the exceptional Americans who made this historic feat possible. Keith Pastorino is an electrician here in Rawsonville. Keith, please tell us what you’ve done. How you like it. Come on up. Let’s see Keith. Oh, look at Keith. Thank you Keith. Love to grab him and shake his hand, but I guess we can’t do that, can you.
Thank you very much Keith. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Great people. We’re also joined by Gary Brabant, a quality technician. Gary come on up, Gary. Thanks Gary.
Thank you very much. Thank you Gary. Thank you, Gary, very much. With us as well is Adrian Price, who has helped lead this effort as one of Ford’s top engineers, highly respected. Come on up please Adrian.
Thank you. Thank you.
I bought plenty of them. I bought plenty of them. Thank you Adrian. Yep. I have a lot of those Lincolns. That’s great. Thank you very much. The global pandemic has proven once and for all that to be a strong nation America must be a manufacturing nation. We are bringing it back, 600,000 jobs. Previous administration said, "Manufacturing jobs, we’re not doing that. It’s gone from this country." They were wrong. Six hundred thousand jobs until we had to turn it off, and now we’re going to turn it back on like never before. You’ll see numbers that you didn’t even see the last time. We’re going to rebuild it quickly. It’s going to happen very quickly. We’re already seeing indications of that. Larry Kudlow gave some numbers that were really inspiring this morning, based on what we’re hearing and seeing.
True national independence requires economic independence from day one. I’ve been fighting to bring back our jobs from China, and many other countries. Today I’m declaring a simple but vital national goal. The United States will be the world’s premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. We’re bringing our medicines back, and many other things too. We must produce critical equipment, supplies, pharmaceuticals, technologies, for ourselves. We cannot rely on foreign nations to take care of us, especially in times of difficulty. In previous decades, politicians shipped away our jobs, outsourced our supply chains, and offshored our industries. They sent them abroad. We’re bringing them back, and we’ve been doing that long before this crisis. We’re bringing them back. That’s why we have so many plants being built all over the United States that make a beautiful product called cars. Bringing them back. You see it. I told Prime Minister Abe of Japan, " Shinzo, you got to get them back." We have many Japanese companies now building car companies here. I said, "You’ve got to bring them back." We’ve had deficits with all of these countries for years, and years, and years. They were ripping us left and right. We had no idea. We had no leader that understood what the hell was happening, but now you do.
I said, "You got to bring them back." We made a great deal with South Korea. We made a great deal with Japan. We have $40 billion dollars Japan is putting into the United States, not to mention all of the plants that they’re building. The South Korea deal was a terrible deal, and we made it good. Hillary Clinton actually made that deal. She said, "It’s going to produce 250,000 jobs," and she was right. It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us. Wasn’t too good was it? But we are bringing it all back to our country, and it started long before this happened. Maybe that’s one of the reasons this happened. Maybe people weren’t so thrilled with what was going on. But we had the greatest year in the history of our country, and have it again very soon.
In this administration, we know that it matters where someone works on something, and where something is made. As we’ve seen today, companies like your great Ford, and workers like you are a national treasure. I consider Ford to be a national treasure. I consider you to be a national treasure, the talent, because that talent, and culture, and commitment to winning, are irreplaceable. Your patriotism can not be outsourced. Your 117 years of incredible manufacturing heritage cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world. The talent, I see the talent. I know what talent is. I understand your world, and I understand your business. That’s why in my administration, we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American.
Buy American and hire American. And we have another rule that you may have heard on occasion. It’s called America first. We didn’t have America first. We had America last under previous presidents. They were more concerned with the world than they were concerned with their own country. My first week in office, I withdrew from the job wrecking Trans Pacific Partnership, which would have destroyed the auto industry. I never asked you about that bill. I mean, I think you agree. Oh, you do? Would you please stand up and just not that you agree? Your industry bill would have been destroyed had that deal gone through and not only yours by the way, but other countries would have been very happy. So I don’t know. I don’t know how to hell these unions aren’t endorsing Trump instead of the standard Democrat. A Democrat that doesn’t even know where he is.
We renegotiated the catastrophic deal with South Korea to preserve the protective tariff on foreign made pickup trucks. The Chicken Tax, they call it, right? You know what the Chicken Tax is? Most profitable thing you have. You know why? Because of the Chicken Tax that was expiring a year ago, and I got it extended. Because of that tax, it’s one of the most profitable products. You live for that product, right? I kept my promise to replace the NAFTA disaster with a brand new USMCA, which is a fantastic deal for our country. Tough new requirements under the USMCA ensure more cars to be built in American plants by American labor and even labor endorsed it. But the big thing is you’re losing all your car industry. You weren’t going to have a car industry left.
Now people aren’t going to be moving back to Mexico. They’re not going to be moving back and you’re going to have it the other way. At the same time we preserve our relationship. Mexico’s actually been very nice. Our border is the strongest it’s ever been. We’re up to over 200 miles at brand new, beautiful border wall. And that 200 miles is pristine. Nobody comes through. This is a serious wall. It’s a serious wall. And it’s incredible what we’ve done there, too. We had among the best months we’ve ever had. And now when somebody comes across, we bring them back. We don’t go through five years of litigation in the other days or the older days. Not so long ago, if they stepped a foot into our country, you had to be Perry Mason. You end up in a court case and it took years. You’d release them into the country by law. And then you say, "Come back in five years for your trial." And only the very stupid people came back. About 2%. They didn’t come back. Why should they come back? They were released into our country. We don’t do that. We don’t do that. And we want people coming into our country, but we want them to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally. It’s very important. I’ll continue to fight for US auto workers as we rebuild our economic strength. Our strategy for a phased and responsible reopening protects those lives, those American lives, those high risk American lives from the virus while allowing those at Loris, such as young, healthy people, where they just have a much, much lower risk. We’ve learned a lot. You’re a certain age, you have a problem with diabetes, or you have a problem with your heart, you’re a prime suspect for this horrible disease. It’s a terrible thing.
So we’ve learned that young people do very well. Very well, incredibly well. Older people, especially older people that have problems, they don’t do well at all. So we have to protect those people and we want to get everybody now safely back to work. And we’re going to do that. I spoke today about our churches. Our churches have closed. And I said to CDC, I had a great conversation. I said, "Our people want to go back to church on Sundays. And our churches want to take care of their parishioners, their people that go to worship." And a you’re going to see something come out very soon about opening up our churches.
A permanent lockdown is not a strategy for a healthy state or a healthy country. Our country wasn’t meant to be shut down. We did the right thing, but now it’s time to open it up. A never ending lock down would invite a public health calamity. To protect the health of our people, we must have a functioning economy. And as I said, and I’ll say it a hundred times, we’re going to have an incredible year next year, right at the beginning, even our fourth quarter is going to be very good. There’s a tremendous pent up demand. That includes for your cars. Americans who need and want to return to work should not be vilified. They should be supported unlike many politicians and journalists. For those who earn a living with their own two hands, working remotely is just not an option. You don’t have the option of doing that.
Our plan emphasizes safety and protection for returning employees. I want to commend Ford along with General Motors, General Electric, Fiat Chrysler, and so many other companies. A lot of them in this area for blazing, a trail to safely restart America’s economic engines. You are demonstrating that we can open our country while taking precautions like social distancing, daily medical screenings, strict hygiene. You can get tremendous numbers of very quick temperature checks. Whoever heard they aim a camera right there and two seconds later, they tell you your temperature. More accurately than the old days where you put it under your tongue for two and a half minutes. This is a little better. But you get temperature checks.
And I want to thank you all for leading America back to work. You look at states like Florida, Georgia, and many others where the numbers have actually gone down. They’re open, but their numbers are going down and very substantially down. With your help and our policies, this country is poised for an epic comeback. This is going to be an incredible comeback. Watch, it’s already happening. Within the next year, we are going to be exceeding any expectation and I’ve had a good gut feeling about a lot of things, including running for president. I said, "I think I could win." And I guess I was right. Everyone here today, and by the way, I think we’re going to do better the second time. And it’s very important that we win the second time or everything that we’ve done, including manufacturing, jobs, all this is going to be not in a very good position.
Everyone here today is the heir to a majestic and noble tradition. You walk in the footsteps of those who built the Motor City in the 1920s and thirties, who stocked the arsenal of democracy in the 1940s, and who set the standard for automotive safety and style in the 1950s and sixties and beyond. And even today, Bill was showing me some of those cars, it’s a credible. I wanted to buy one, then I heard the price. I said, "Forget it." I said, "I’ll use one on occasion, right?" But what a car that is, huh? What a car.
Our friends and allies marveled at these triumphs of American industry and our enemies learned that nothing can stop the strength and power and grit of the American worker, nothing. Just like generations of Michigan manufacturers before you, each of you has done your best for America in its time of need. You love your country. You love your country so much. Now you have a critical role to play in forging a new legacy of American greatness that will inspire and endure for generations to come. It’s a very important time in our country’s history and our country’s life. Because of you, the Ford name will forever stand as a symbol of American excellence, innovation, quality, and craftsmanship. And because of you, America will be strong and healthy and prosperous and free for many, many decades to come.
I want to say very powerfully, very strongly, God bless you all. God bless America. I’m proud to be here. I’m proud to be with Ford. Bill, thank you very much. Everyone, thank you very much. We’ll be back. We’ll see you a lot. Good luck. John James, thank you for being here. We’re going to have a great Senator, John James. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
And a lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out. And you’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers, before you catch it. The frontline workers, many, many are taking it. I happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it.
I’m taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now. Yeah. Couple of weeks ago I started taking it. Because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you right. I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things. I’d take it. Frontline workers take it. A lot of doctors take it. Excuse me. A lot of doctors take it. I take it. Now, I hope to not be able to take it soon because I hope they come up with some answer. But I think people should be allowed to. I got a letter from a doctor the other day from Westchester, New York, around the area. He didn’t want anything. He just said, "Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine. I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin. And I give them zinc. And out of the hundreds of patients, many hundreds, over 300 patients, I haven’t lost one." He said, "Please keep pressing that, sir."
And if you look at that phony report that was put in, that report on the hydroxy was given to people that were in extraordinarily bad condition, extraordinary bad. People that were dying. No, I think for whatever it’s worth, I take it. I would have told you that three, four days ago, but we never had a chance because you never asked me the question.
Yeah, White House doctor. He didn’t recommend it. No, I asked him, "What do you think?" He said, "Well, if you’d like it." I said, "Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it." A lot of people are taking it. A lot of frontline workers are taking hydroxychloroquine. I don’t take it because hey, people said, "Oh, maybe he owns the company." No, I don’t own the company. You know what? I want the people of this nation to feel good. I don’t want them being sick. And there’s a very good chance that this has an impact, especially early on. But you look at frontline workers, you look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative. And they’re taking, totally unrelated, but they take the Z-Pak or the azithromycin for possible infection. Now, I haven’t taken that other than an original dose because all you need, you don’t have to take it simultaneously. But the zinc, you do take. So I’m taking the two, the zinc and the hydroxy. And all I can tell you is so far, I seem to be okay.
No. No, not at all. I just said that I’ve had so many letters from people like the one I told you about, I got it last week. Would you like a copy of it? I’d love to give you  If you ask Molly, she’ll give you a copy of it. But this is a doctor. He doesn’t want anything. I don’t know him, never heard of him. But he treats people that we’re talking about. And he said out of hundreds of people that he’s treated, he hasn’t lost one. And he just wanted me to know about it. That’s all. He wasn’t saying, "Gee, can I have dinner with you, Mr. President? I’d like to come to the White House."
But I’ve received many such letters. I’ve received a lot of positive letters. And it seems to have an impact. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t. But if it doesn’t, you’re not going to get sick or die. This is a pill that’s been used for a long time, for 30, 40 years on the malaria and on lupus too. And even on arthritis, I guess, from what I understand. So it’s been heavily tested in terms of  I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this, when I announced this, but I’ve taken it for about a week and a half now and I’m still here. I’m still here.
Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it. The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it, was it the VA? With people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it. And we’ve done the greatest job, maybe of anything in the VA, because I got VA Choice and VA Accountability both approved. Accountability, Tillman, is where you can fire bad people that work in the VA that you couldn’t fire them. We had thousands of people that were sadists, that were stealing, that were robbers, that were horrible people. They’d beat up our veterans. They couldn’t do it in primetime, but they did it when they were sick. And we got accountability. Nobody thought you could get it because of the unions and civil service. I got it passed so that now you fire bad people in the VA. We got rid of tremendously bad people that should never been there.
But I also got, probably even more importantly, if you can say that, maybe not, VA Choice. So if you have to wait on line for a doctor, you go outside, you have a private doctor, we pay the bill. We work out deals with doctors. We have pricing. So you go out and you pay the bill. And it was a great thing that we did. So we’ve done a great job with the VA, but they had a report come out. And the results of the report, it was very unscientific report by the way.
But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, "Hey, you know the expression I’ve used, John? What do you have to lose?" Okay, what do you have to lose? So I have been taking it for about a week and a half.
Every day, I take a pill every day. At some point, I’ll stop. What I’d like to do is I’d like to have the cure or the vaccine and that’ll happen, I think, very soon.
Zero symptoms. No, I haven’t had any. No, I tested. I test every couple of days, they want to test me, for obvious reasons. I mean, I am the President. So they want to test me. I don’t want to be tested, but they want to test me. So every couple of days I get tested. And I’ve shown always negative, right? Negative. Is that the term you use for this? Right? Negative. Totally negative. No symptoms, no nothing. But no, I take it because I think I hear very good things. Again, you have to go to frontline workers. Many frontline workers take it and they seem to be doing very well.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It’s very hot today. Please sit down. This is going to be a very hot one and we apologize to everybody out there that’s got to suffer through it. But you know what? It’s better than bad weather and it’s great to be in the rose garden. I want to especially thank this group for joining us as we announce a historic groundbreaking initiative in our ongoing effort to rapidly develop and manufacture a coronavirus vaccine. We’re joined by secretary Steven Mnuchin, Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary Alex Azar, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, FDA Director, Dr. Stephen Hahn, Director of the National Institute of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. We’re joined by a very terrific group of professionals.
Tomorrow will mark 30 days since we released the White House guidelines for a safe and phased opening of America. That’s what we’re doing. It’s the opening of America. We’re going to have an amazing year next year. We’re going to have a great transition into the fourth quarter. As of this morning, almost every state has taken steps to begin reopening and the American people are doing an extraordinary job of continuing to take precautions while at the same time wanting to start, and they will be starting, to resume their American way of life. We will be reigniting our economic engines. We’re going to be taking care of our most vulnerable, which are our senior citizens and some others. We’re going to be working very, very hard on our senior citizens and our nursing homes and various communities to support those that are struggling in this very difficult time. Others don’t have the same kind of struggle.
For example, today, Secretary Perdue, together with Ivanka Trump, launched the Farmers and Families Food Box Program, which will provide $3 billion to help small farmers. And it will be helping farmers, ranchers, but it’ll be bringing food to some of the food lines and some of the food kitchens that you’ve been seeing on television. And I said, "Why aren’t we doing that? We have all of this tremendous food produced by our farmers and our ranchers." And so we’re going to be buying $3 billion worth of that food, great for everybody. Our farmers, our ranchers, and the people that need great food.
A key feature of our reopening plan is the largest and most ambitious testing system in the world by far. America is now conducting close to 350,000 tests per day, an unthinkable number just a short while ago, more than anybody in the world by far, suggesting many states now have excess testing capacity to monitor for new outbreaks. Florida, many other states have so much testing the testers are waiting for people to show up. It’s great.
Another essential pillar of our strategy to keep America open is the development of effective treatments and vaccines as quickly as possible. Want to see if we can do that very quickly. We’re looking to, when I say quickly, we’re looking to get it by the end of the year if we can, maybe before. We’re doing tremendously well. From the earliest days of the pandemic, we have marshaled the genius of American scientists and researchers from all across government and the private sector, from academia, from everywhere to vanquish the virus, and tremendous strides have been made. Can tell you, I get to see it every day. Tremendous strides are being made. Scientists at the NIH began developing the first vaccine candidate on January 11th, think of that, within hours of the virus’s genetic code being posted online. So January 11th, most people never even heard what was going on January 11th. And we were out there trying to develop a vaccine, not even knowing what we were up against. Then my administration cut through every piece of red tape to achieve the fastest ever, by far, launch of a vaccine trial for this new virus, this very vicious virus. And I want to thank all of the doctors and scientists and researchers involved because they’ve never moved like this or never even close.
The NIH and the HHS have also been working constantly with private industry to evaluate more than 100 potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has swiftly approved more than 130 therapies for active trials. That’s what we have right now, 130. And another 450 are in the planning stages and tremendous potential awaits. I think we’re going to have some very interesting things to report in the not too distant future. And thank you very much to Dr. Hahn. Through a historic series of funding bills, my administration is providing roughly $10 billion to support a medical research effort without parallel. I especially want to thank Senator Steve Daines of Montana for his incredible work. He has worked so hard to secure additional funding for vaccine development. He has been right at the forefront.
Today, I want to update you on the next stage of this momentous medical initiative. It’s called Operation Warp Speed. That means big and it means fast, a massive scientific, industrial and logistical endeavor unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project. You really could say that nobody’s seen anything like we’re doing, whether it’s ventilators or testing. Nobody’s seen anything like we’re doing now within our country since the second World War, incredible. Its objective is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we’d love to see if we could do it prior to the end of the year. We think we’re going to have some very good results coming out very quickly.
In addition, it will continue accelerating the development of diagnostics and breakthrough therapies. The great national project will bring together the best of American industry and innovation, the full resources of the United States government, and the excellence and precision of the United States military. We have the military totally involved. We’re also working very strongly with other countries who are also have some great, great scientists, doctors, and we’re all working very closely together and they’re viewing us as the leader and we are. The relationship with other countries on solving this problem has been incredible. Today, the Operation Warp Speed has brought together all of the experts across the federal government from places like the NIH, CDC, FDA, and many other agencies. This historic partnership will now bring together the full resources of the Department of Health and Human Services with the Department of Defense. And we know what that means. That means the full power and strength of military, the military, and that really talking about the logistics. We get it when we get it. That means the logistics, getting it out so that everybody can take it.
And today, we’re proud to announce the addition of two of the most highly respected skilled professionals in our country, worldwide respected. Operation Warp Speed’s chief scientists will be Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a world renowned immunologist who helped create 14 new vaccines, that’s a lot of our new vaccines, in 10 years during his time in the private sector. One of the most respected men in the world in the production and, really, on the formulation of vaccines. Joining Dr. Slaoui as Chief Operating Officer will be General Gus Perna, a four star general who currently oversees 190,000 service members, civilians, and contractors as Commander of the US Army Material Command. That means logistics. That means getting it out. We’ve got to get it out there. So General, thank you very much. And doctor, thank you very much. It’s great to have you on board. Really highly respected people. Thank you.
It’s great to have you on board. Really highly respected people. Thank you.
These two outstanding individuals will provide more details following my remarks. In preparation for this initiative, experts throughout the government have been collaborating to evaluate roughly 100 vaccine candidates from all over the world. They have identified 14 that they believe are the most promising and they’re working to narrow that list still further. So we started off with over 100, we’re down to 14, and we have some really interesting choices to be made. They’re doing very well.
Through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government is providing unprecedented support and resources to safely expedite the trials. Moving on at record, record, record speed. While we accelerate the final phases of vaccine trials, Operation Warp Speed will be simultaneously accelerating its manufacturing and manufacturing process. In other words, we’re getting ready so that when we get the good word that we have the vaccine, we have the formula, we have what we need, we’re ready to go. As opposed to taking years to gear up. We’re gearing up. It’s risky, it’s expensive, but we’ll be saving massive amounts of time. We’ll be saving years if we do this properly. And that’s what we’re doing. So we’re gearing up on the assumption that we’ll have in the near future, relatively near future, a vaccine.
Typically pharmaceutical companies wait to manufacture a vaccine until it has received all of the regulatory approvals necessary. And this can delay vaccines availability to the public as much as a year, and even more than that. However, our task is so urgent that under Operation Warp Speed, the federal government will invest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine candidates before they’re approved. So we’re knowing exactly what we’re doing before they’re approved. That means they better come up with a good vaccine, because we’re ready to deliver it. This will eliminate any unnecessary delay and enable us to begin providing Americans with a proven vaccine the day our scientists say, "We’re ready, we got it."
And as we work to bring critical medical production back to America, these vaccines that we’re going to be focused on and manufacturing, they’re all going to be right here in the USA. Now we’re working, as I said, with other people outside, and that’s fine too. We want to get to the solution. We know exactly where the other countries are and we’ll be very happy if they were able to do it. We’ll help them with delivery, we’ll help them with it in every way we can. We have no ego when it comes to this. No ego whatsoever. Operation Warp Speed is also making the necessary preparations to distribute these life saving treatments at scale. So we’re talking about massive numbers so that millions of Americans will quickly have access to them. This includes ramping up production of supplies needed for distribution. And I have to say, we’re also very, very much involved in other things other than the vaccine. If you take a look at what we’re doing beyond vaccines, it’s going to be very interesting. We may talk about that in a little while. But this includes ramping up production of supplies needed for distribution, such as cold chain storage, glass vials, needles, syringes, and more. We’ll have everything right on hand, ready to go.
When a vaccine is ready, the US government will deploy every plane, truck and soldier required to help distribute it to the American people as quickly as possible. America’s blessed to have the most brilliant, talented doctors and researchers anywhere in the world. We have the mightiest military by far in the world. Our military is completely rebuilt. Much of the equipment has been delivered. Some of it’s on the way. All made right here in the USA. We took over very, very empty cupboards, I say, medically. We also had empty cupboards in a military sense. Our military was in sad shape. It was depleted. We now have the strongest military the United States has ever had by far, and the best equipment. And you hear that outside, that beautiful sound, those are truckers that are with us all the way. They’re protesting in favor of President Trump, as opposed to against. There’s hundreds of trucks out there. And that’s the sign of love, not the sign of your typical protest. So I want to thank our great truckers. They like me and I like them. We’re working on something together.
But we have the mightiest And they’ll be helping us with this, by the way. Speaking of truckers. We have the mightiest military in the long history of humankind. We have the best and most devoted workers ever to walk the face of the earth. And now we’re combining all of these amazing strengths for the most aggressive vaccine project in history. There’s never been a vaccine project anywhere in history like this. And I just want to make something clear. It’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back. And we’re starting the process. And in many cases they don’t have vaccines and a virus or a flu comes and you fight through it. We haven’t seen anything like this in 100 and some odd years, 1917, but you fight through it. And people sometimes, I guess, we don’t know exactly yet, but it looks like they become immune or at least for a short while and maybe for life. But you fight through it. But what we’d like to do, if we can, is the vaccine. And I think we’re going to be successful in doing it, and hopefully by the end of the year.
Just as generations of Americans before us faced down the most difficult trials, set their sights on the highest summit and overcame the biggest obstacles, america will meet the moment, and this moment specifically in our time, with unrivaled speed, unmatched scale, and the unyielding spirit of the American people. Our nation will come back stronger and greater than ever. We’re going to have a tremendous year next year. We’re going to have a really good fourth quarter. We’re going to have a very interesting and productive transition quarter, where Steve is there, And I’m sure our Secretary of the Treasury, I think you feel the same way, Steve. And thank you for your good work. Really good work. And it’s not finished yet, is it? I want to thank Steve Mnuchin, everybody.
Now I’d like to ask Dr. and General Perna to come up and say a few words, followed by Secretary Azar and Secretary Esper. Thank you all very much. We’re doing something that has never been done before. It’s a going to result in a tremendous end. I think we’re going to come up with a solution to a problem like this country probably has never seen before. But it’s an honor to be your president. We’re doing a great job. These people are doing an incredible job. The people right here, I want to thank you all. Total professionals. Great men, great women. Thank you all very much. Please.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Excuse me, you’re going to have to remove it. You can’t hear through your
No, we’re looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it. Not everybody’s going to want to get it, but we’re looking at a full vaccine. Is that a correct statement?
We’ve all been tested. I’ve been tested. We’ve all been tested and we’re quite a distance away and we’re outdoor. So I told them, I gave them the option. They could wear it or not. So you can blame it on me, but I gave them the option. We could wear it or not. Yeah, please.
The last thing anybody’s looking for is profit in terms of what we’re doing. Every company, they want to get it out. We’ve had a great experience. We’ve had a great experience on everything we’ve done. People are looking to come up with the answer. They’re not looking in  Typically they’re saying, "How much am I going to make? How much?" They really have been, there’s been a great spirit on this. They want to get to the bottom of it. And I think we’ll be able to do that.
So, India has been so great. And as you know, your prime minister has been a very good friend of mine. I just got back a short while ago from India recently, and we’re working very much with India too. We have a tremendous Indian population in the United States. Many of the people that you’re talking about are working on the vaccine too, great scientists and researchers. Yeah. We’re working very closely also with India. Correct. And say hello to your prime minister. Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Yeah, I think we’ve done a good job with that. Certain areas have been hit very hard, New York, New Jersey, et cetera, et cetera, working very closely with the governors. We’ve worked with all of the governors. We’ve made a lot of people look very good with what we’ve done on ventilators, with what we’ve done on testing. We’re working with all of the governors. We just sent a big transit package to New Jersey. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, who is a terrific person, by the way, I have to tell you. And I just told him, "A lot of money’s coming way for the transit." And also I spoke with the governor of New York, Governor Cuomo. We just had a conversation yesterday. We’re sending them a lot of transportation money. So it’s important. But we’ve had a very good relationship working with all of the states, regardless. All of the states. And if we do get fortunate enough, and I think we’re skilled enough, but fortunate enough to have a vaccine, it’ll get out fairly and quickly.
I think that makes sense, perhaps. Perhaps it does, but I would say probably, but I think they’re all going to get well distributed. If you remember where we started, we had no ventilators. We had to make them and we became a very major manufacturer of ventilators. Now we’re helping countries all over the world with ventilators. We’re sending them to many countries all over the world. When we started, we didn’t have ventilators. I inherited nothing. I inherited practically nothing from the previous administration, unfortunately. Yeah, go ahead.
Well, I don’t want to talk about it. I can say China is buying a lot of our product, but the trade deal, the ink was barely dry when this came in from China. So it’s not like we’re thrilled. Okay, go ahead. Please.
Yeah.
Well, I don’t know what happened. I know that Voice of America is run in a terrible manner, terrible. They’re not the voice of America, they’re the opposite of the voice of America. And we have a man who is very good. I don’t know. He’s in the nominating process, but I’ll have to check that out. Yeah, please.
Well, I think a very big factor frankly is that very few people are  We read about all of the very sad, very tragic. I’ve lost friends. Many of us have lost friends. We read about that and we see that, and that’s what the news covers, but it’s a very small percentage. It’s a very, very small percentage. I say it all the time. It’s a tiny percentage. The vast majority, many people don’t even know they have it. They have it or they have sniffles or they have a very minor sign and they recover. Not only recover, they probably have immunity, whether it’s short term, long term, but they have probably immunity. And I think people have to understand that. That’s why I think the schools should be back in the fall. I think that lots of things should happen. I don’t think that you should have 70 year old teachers back yet. They should wait until everything is gone. I don’t think you should have a professor that’s 65 and has diabetes, or has a bad heart back necessarily, or somebody that’s older than that. But we want to see our schools back.
We want to see our country start to work again. We created the greatest economy in the history of the world and we’re going to do it again. And you’re going to see that next year. And it’s going to start, you’ll start to see it in the fourth quarter, maybe even before that. Yeah.
I’m concerned about everything. And I’m also concerned about our country. Our country has to get back. What you’re talking is when you are doing what we did with the shutdown, that causes death also. It causes massive depression. It causes drugs, it causes suicide. It causes a lot of problems also. No, our country has to get back to work again. And you see that just looking and reading everything that’s happening are people want to get back. They want to get back. Yeah.
We do. We do. We have a great plan to prevent the spread, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to close our country for five years. Okay. Not going to happen.
Go ahead.
At current, it’s about 86,000. Yes.
Or lower than that, I don’t know. I don’t know. Those are the numbers that are being reported. I assume they’re correct. Unlike other countries, I mean, you have some countries, obviously, you have some that are very obviously ridiculous, but our numbers are accurate numbers. We don’t do anything with the numbers one way or the other. Whatever it is, that’s what we do. We take the numbers as reported. Okay?
Oh, I don’t know. I don’t know. If they were, I’d be very happy if they were lower. I’d like to see numbers lower. I’d like to see no death at all. One death is too many. This should have never happened. This came from China. It should have been stopped in China before it got out to the world. We have 186, it’s been updated this morning, 186 countries are affected, and each country that’s affected is the same thing. Russia now is badly affected. France is badly affected. You look at what each country, and you can say affected, or you can say infected, either way you want to put it, but you look at these countries. Look at Italy and you look at Spain and you look at all of these great countries in many cases, how they’ve had to fight through this. It’s a terrible thing that happened. It could have been stopped at the source. It should have been stopped right at the source, but it wasn’t. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, all that social distancing. Look at you people all spread out, six feet, that’s pretty impressive. But we like it the old way, a little bit better, don’t we? And we’ll be back. We’ll be back to that soon, I think, I really believe it. We were received by thousands and thousands of people coming in and they came in from all over and all the way from the airport to here was really something special, so it was really great. Sit down, let’s have a little fun and we’ll talk. And then we’ll talk about the business and the great job that you’re doing and we really appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. I’m honored, in the heart of the Lehigh Valley. Now, just so you know, I have a brother who was a great brother, passed away a long time ago, Fred, and he went to Lehigh University. I’ve been up here many times actually. And I gave a commencement address years ago at Lehigh University, it’s a great school. But whenever I think of this area, I think about my brother.
But I really am honored to be with extraordinary workers of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Every day you prove that American workers are truly the best in the world, and that’s what they are. We’re showing that now, we’re starting to make one more product in the United States. I with some of your representatives, associates, they call themselves. I assume if they’re associates you’re all making the same money, I hope so. They call themselves associates, sounds nice, right, more and more I see that. But it is good and they’re good and they’re doing a great job, frankly. But they’re talking about so much of the product now is made in the USA whereas in the past it wasn’t, it wasn’t. But they were talking about 90%, 80 to 90% of what you distribute is now made in the USA. And that’s taken a long while for us to get it. I started that right from the beginning. It’s probably one of the major reasons that I’m here. It’s called America first. We want America first, we love the world, we want America first.
Today we’re announcing a groundbreaking initiative to replenish and modernize our strategic national stockpile, the cupboards were bare, you’ve heard me say it a lot. When we came into this administration, those cupboards were bare. I’ve come to this major medical supply distribution hub because the workers here at Owens and Minor have a critical role in this national effort. And it’s a critical role that you fulfilled incredibly well, or I wouldn’t be here. I would have found someplace else. And thank you for those beautiful hats, I appreciate it, thank you. Thank you very much.
From the moment this terrible virus reached our shores, each of you has worked relentlessly to get the vital supplies to our healthcare warriors and they are warriors aren’t they? When you see them going into those hospitals and they’re putting the stuff that you deliver, but they’re wrapping themselves and the doors are opening and they’re going through the doors and they’re not even ready to go through those doors. They probably shouldn’t, but they can’t get there fast enough. And they’re running into death, just like soldiers, running to bullets in a true sense. I see that with the doctors and the nurses and so many of the people that go into those hospitals, it’s incredible to see, it’s a beautiful thing to see. But I really call them warriors, we’re all warriors. Everyone in our country is a warrior. We have to be because of what happened. And it should’ve never happened, should’ve been stopped at the source.
But each of you has worked relentlessly to get the supplies to our healthcare warriors and all across the hospitals and specifically for this plant in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. As you know, the pandemic has inflicted profound hardship, especially in the areas that you serve. Within one heartbeat, America grieves for every life and every family, all of those that have been lost and all over the world, 186, as of this morning, 186 countries. What a horrible shame. And we thank God for the courage of those on the front lines and you make it possible for them. Just as the men and women of Allentown have done in every generation, I know it well, the workers in this facility have answered the call in America’s hour of need.
Many of you are working long before dawn, get up and you go to work and long after midnight. I know your hours, I was talking to your people and your representatives they say  I’m saying, what are the hours? They said, "You won’t even believe it." I said, "But don’t work those hours too, we’re all working hard." You’re driving forklifts, staging pallets, packing, picking loading, and shipping all sorts of things all over these primarily three states. Since February, you have deployed an amazing 1.75 million and 95 respirators and you make them now yourselves. 3.4 million gowns, 80 million gloves and much more. And on behalf of our nation, I want to thank you because you’re making America proud. We really do, we thank you very much. Thank you all.
I’m grateful to Owens and Minor president, Edward Pesicka, along with your chief operating officer Jeff Jochims. We’re also joined by Secretary Alex Azar, doing a terrific job and your statement to the press today was fantastic. He made a very impassioned, strong, powerful statement today. FEMA administrator, Pete Gaynor. Pete, thank you very much. Great job. Fantastic job, you’re dealing directly, you and Admiral John Polowczyk. Where’s the Admiral? Great job, thank you very much. Are they doing a good job here Admiral? Huh? Good. When the Admiral says yes, that means you’re doing a good job. And the CEO of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, Adam Bowler, thank you Adam, fantastic. Every incredible worker here today is part of the greatest mobilization of American society since World War II. You know that, right? We’ve done things with generators and ventilators and so many different things. We’re making products that nobody ever thought would ever need in any mass form. Ventilators is the biggest thing.
We make plenty of ventilators, which was very little in the country because most hospitals didn’t need very many. And all of a sudden they said, we need hundreds of thousands of ventilators. We need kinds of numbers that you wouldn’t believe. And we were mobilized and with Adam and with the Admiral and with all of these people and Jared, somewhere Jared is here, what they did is incredible. We brought geniuses in from Silicon Valley. And all of a sudden, within a short period of time, we had 11 plants up making ventilators and you wouldn’t believe what it is. And now we have so many, every state has more than they need. We filled up our stockpile. We have over 10,000 now and we filled it up. We’re ready to go in case anything happens, but I don’t think-
And we filled it up. We’re ready to go in case anything happens, but I don’t think anything will happen where you’re going to need any more. And we’re now helping other countries with ventilators because nobody can make, you can’t make them, they’re very tough to make, very expensive. I say it’s tougher than making a car. And we make the best ventilator too. So they’ve done a fantastic job. And two months ago, you couldn’t get a ventilator. We were left virtually none.
Over the past few months, the federal government has partnered with Owens & Minor and other distributors to launch the very successful and historic project Airbridge, which is really being thought of and spoken of in glowing terms. Nearly 150 flights have brought 95 million masks, 16 million gowns, and 921 million gloves to America. Can you believe that? 921 million gloves, it’s not even conceivable. Guided by our team workers like you, distributed over 1 billion pieces of protective gear to places in need, a truly remarkable accomplishment. After meeting the immediate demand, we’ll be transforming and transitioning from project Airbridge to sealift, where we’re using big ships, giant ships. That’s less expensive and they can carry a lot more. And we don’t need the speed anymore because we’re very stocked up.
Now as our country begins a safe and gradual reopening, we’re launching a monumental effort to replenish and rebuild the Strategic National Stockpile. And we also did that, by the way, more fuel. When oil went down, we replenished our Strategic National Reserve. And we got it for a great price. Would you believe what went on with fuel? But now it’s starting to go back and we’re saving our energy industry because people didn’t need too much gasoline when there were no cars in the road. And I said to the governors, I said, "There are no cars on the road, this is a good time to fix your highways, fix your highways now." Some did and some didn’t. Right? They didn’t. They were worried that two people working 35 feet away from each other or driving a tractor or whatever they might be doing, they’ll catch the virus. But the ones that did were really helped because you went from being these massive traffic jams to having no traffic. And I can tell you Florida was a state, great governor. And Ron was, he told me, he said, "I’m doing it." I said, "That’s a good thing." Not everybody did it. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Governor of Florida. But some did and they’ve saved tremendous amounts of money. In rush hour, they’re building and they hardly had to close a lane. So a lot of good things you can do, but some people decided not to do that.
Under the previous administration, the stockpile was depleted and never fully refilled. Most of the N-95 masks were distributed during the N1H1. Now, you know what says that, right? N1H1, who says that? Sleepy Joe Biden. Remember? He said the N1H1. I said, "Isn’t it the other way around?" They said, "Yes, sir." But he said it. So it doesn’t make any difference. But during the H1N1, and that’s the swine flu, and it was a pandemic in ’09 that was not well handled at all, got very poor marks. Never again will another President inherit empty shelves or expired products, at least hopefully in five years, you’re talking about. Maybe nine years, maybe 13 years. But you’ll never have to deal with empty shelves and you’ll never have to deal with the depleted military. The military that we took over was depleted and in horrible shape. We’ve now spent $1.5 trillion rebuilding our military. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had by far. And this is a good time to have it too. And all of the product was built in the USA. But I’m determined that America will be fully prepared for any of the future outbreaks, of which we hope there’s going to be none. Who would’ve thought? 1917, it could have been up to 100 million people were killed in that was the Spanish flu. 1917. Who would have thought this was going to happen? That’s over 100 years ago.
Our effort begins by dramatically increasing our reserves. Instead of one to three weeks worth of supplies, which we had less than that, the US government will now stockpile three whole months, much of it made in the USA. My administration has already awarded contracts for approximately 200,000 ventilators, which we’re building ourselves. And now that we’re restocking all of those, great things are happening with ventilators. My administration has also ordered 800 million N-95 respirators and face masks. Face masks also, we’re making here. Last week I was at Honeywell. Great company, high tech company. And they’re making masks. And they’re making face masks. They’re making a lot of different things that three months ago, they never even thought about. They’ve geared up. It’s incredible what some of the companies have been able to do. You’ve seen that, what Honeywell has done, incredible job they’ve done.
But many of them are manufactured by Owens & Minor. Many of the things that we’re doing and delivering happily to places that were not able to get it, done by Owens & Minor. Thanks to a major investment in Del Rio, Texas, your company plans to produce an astounding 20 million N-95 masks per month. That’s more than you do here. I don’t know. You’re going to take that? I don’t think so. That won’t last long, right? Now, think of that. 20 million N-95 masks per month. And it’s going to be very shortly.
Next, my administration has taken action to modernize the stockpiles during this crisis. Admiral Polowczyk and his team built a cutting edge system that allows the federal government to integrate seamlessly with our nation’s largest distributors to procure, produce, and deliver astonishing quantities of supplies where they need it the most. We have an incredible system. Hope we’re not going to need it, but it’s there, right? It’s there. It’s there like nobody would even believe. And the press doesn’t ever talk about it. They don’t want to talk about that. There they are right there. They don’t want to talk about it. They are a disaster. But that’s okay. The people understand, and that’s all that really matters when you get right down to it.
Going forward, we’ll build on this system to create a stockpile that is not only the best resourced in the world, but also evolves to meet all of the new threats that can happen, things that you’re not even thinking about right now. We’ll continue to partner with American industry and distributors like you to help manage and rotate our vastly expanded inventory. The final step in rebuilding the stockpile is to bring critical manufacturing permanently back to America. Wouldn’t that be nice, right? We’re doing it. And we’ve been doing it. My goal is to produce everything America needs for ourselves, and then export to the world. And that includes medicines. It’s very important. Too reliant on other countries. And I’ve been saying that for a long time, long before I became elected President, right?
long time, long before I became elected president, right? He knows. He’s been hearing it. To this end earlier today, I signed an executive order just signed it, invoking the Defense Production Act to grant new authority to the US International Development Finance Corporation, just a little while on the plane. This federal agency normally invests in economic development projects in other countries. I said, "How about investing in our country?" We invest in other countries. Globalists, do you know what a globalist is? They want the globe to do well, but they don’t care about us. Now, we want everybody to do well, but we have to take care of America first. It’s got to be America first.
And you know what other countries say? Their country first. Why wouldn’t they do that? But we didn’t do that. We had a bunch of globalists that didn’t know what the hell they were doing. But under my order, it will now also invest in our country, helping to bring vital factories, pharmaceutical producers, and most importantly, jobs back home where they belong. Now, we had the greatest economy in the world. We had the best job numbers we’ve ever had. We had almost 160 million people working, we were never even close to that. The best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had, African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic- American, had the best job numbers in history, in the history of our country. They never did so well, best income numbers, best stock market numbers, 401k numbers. The good part is the stock markets because they know, we know what we’re doing, the stock market’s ready to move, never went down like a lot of people said, "Wow, it’s 23, 24,000." It was 29,000. It never went down like people would have assumed because they know what’s happening. They know, smart people, a lot of smart people, they know what’s going to happen.
We are going to have an amazing next year, one of our best, but we had the greatest year ever and then we had to turn it off, artificially induced. We had to turn it off. If we didn’t do that, we would’ve lost 2 million people instead of whether it’s 95,000, a hundred thousand, one is too many, but we would’ve lost 2 million people, maybe more than that, maybe somewhat less. But think of it, even if it was a little less. Multiply what we have by 20, or by 15, wouldn’t be acceptable, wouldn’t be sustainable. People would’ve said, "What’s going on over here? You multiply, as bad as you’ve seen it." And you can say what you want about the flu, but I’ve never lost anybody to the flu that I knew. I mean, I’ve had people, friends, they had the flu and they’re sick, they don’t feel good. And you call up, "How you doing?" Three days, two days, a week later, they’re fine. Nobody ever said they died.
But I’ve lost five people that I know, two people were very good friends of mine and you call up two days later, "How are they doing?" "Sir, they’re in a coma." I said, "They’re in a coma?" Now, they were older. I wouldn’t say they were in the greatest of health. I wouldn’t say their weight was perfect, not perfect, but they’re gone. So it’s just a terrible, terrible thing.
In my administration, we believe in two beautiful rules, buy American and hire American. This afternoon, I also have great news on testing. We’ve been doing testing at a level that nobody’s ever done it before, we can not get any We can not get the press to write about it or write fairly about it. And nobody has ever done, we’ve done double what anyone else If you add up all of the countries in the world, we’ve done more testing than all of the countries in the world, add it up together. Nobody’s ever done anything like that.
And we have the best test. We have tested Two months ago, it didn’t even exist. Our great companies came up with things, Abbott Laboratories and so many others. They came up with things at Roche, they came up with things that nobody even believes. So we have the best testing in the world. It could be the test is frankly overrated. Maybe it is overrated, but whenever they start yelling, "We want more. We want more." They always say, "We want more. We want more," because they don’t want to give you credit. Then we do more. And they say, "We want more." But we have the greatest testing in the world. But what we want is we want to get rid of this thing, it’s what we want. We want to get rid of this thing.
This afternoon, I also have great news on that testing. America has now conducted it ten millionth test, that’s as of yesterday afternoon. 10 million tests we gave, 10 million. And CVS has just committed to establish up to 1000 new coronavirus testing sites by the end of this month. And the 10 millionth will go up very, very rapidly. And don’t forget, we have more cases than anybody in the world, but why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we wouldn’t have very few cases. They don’t want to write that, it’s common sense. So we test much more, many, many times. South Korea you hear about. I spoke with the president of South Korea, spoke with many different presidents, prime ministers. They can’t believe what we’ve been able to do on testing. They can’t believe what we’ve been able to do on ventilators, we’re sending them ventilators.
Other countries, Italy, Spain, other countries, France is having tremendous problems, tremendous problems. We’re helping them with ventilators. They can’t believe the job we’re doing. And it’s not me, it’s the people, all of these people, but it’s the people that are doing it. And they have to be given the proper credit for what they’ve done, because what they did is a miracle. No other country in the world has done what we’ve done. And they feel very free now to call us because they need help, especially with the ventilators, because that’s hard, that’s not a cotton swab. That’s a very hard thing. Very, very hard thing to produce.
Joining us today are a few of the workers who have kept our hospital supplied through this crisis and take part in a great, great rebuilding that’s going forward. I say, it’s the transition to greatness. The transition is the third quarter. The fourth quarter is going to do very well. And next year is going to be through the roof. We have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and they want to keep them closed, can’t do that. Dennis DeCarlo is a Marine Corps veteran who served our country in the Gulf War in Somalia. Now he continues that spirit of services and operations supervisor and Dennis, please come up and say a few words. Come, thank you. Thanks Dennis.
Thank you very much. Please sit. Thank you, be seated please. And Melania, thank you very much. On the second anniversary of the Be Best initiative, you’ve done a fantastic job and everybody appreciates it, but I want to Thank you, and I want to thank you on behalf of the entire nation for all that you do for America’s children and on fighting the drug addiction problem that we have in this country. It’s all over the world, but I want to thank you very much. Great job. You do your work so hard. On this national day of prayer, America is engaged in a fierce battle against a very terrible disease. Throughout our history, in times of challenge, our people have always called upon the gift of faith, the blessing of belief, the power of prayer and the eternal glory of God. I ask all Americans to join their voices and their hearts in spiritual union as we ask our Lord in heaven for strength and solace, for courage and comfort, for hope and healing, for recovery and for renewal.
In recent days and weeks, our country has endured a grave hardship. We pray for every family stricken with grief and devastated with a tragic loss. We pray for the doctors, the nurses and first responders waging war against the invisible enemy. We pray for the scientists’ and researchers’ pioneer treatments, that they find therapies and vaccines and that they find them soon. We pray for the frontline workers keeping our nation fed, nourished and safe and secure. May God watch over them all. We’re honored to have with us today our amazing vice president Mike Pence and his wonderful wife, Karen. Great friends of our nation and great friends of mine and Melania’s, and somebody who’s done an incredible job not only as vice president but as heading the task force which has come up with so many solutions and ideas and things that we didn’t even think about two months ago.
We’re also profoundly grateful to be joined by many faith leaders who are helping to care for our neighbors in their hour of need. Thank you all for providing meals to families, medical supplies to hospitals, and for providing spiritual strength and encouragement to your communities. Very important people, very respected people, and very much loved people. In every part of our country, we’ve seen grace of God through the love and devotion of our fellow citizens as scripture assures us the Lord your God is not your midst, a mighty one who will save. And I think it’s so true. Think of that, the Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save. We have been reminded once again-
who will save. We have been reminded once again that God has blessed our land with heroes of faith. Here with us is Brittany Akinsola from Charlotte, North Carolina. Brittany is a nurse, a pastor, a wife, a mother. When she saw the dire situation in New York City, she volunteered to work at Samaritan’s Purse Field Hospital in Central Park. There she worked 13-hour shifts in the intensive care unit for weeks praying for each patient while giving them the very best care. As Brittany said, "We just keep sharing the love of Christ through our gifts of nursing."
Brittany, America’s forever indebted to you and the incredible job you have done. We very much appreciate it, Brittany. Please come up. Please come up, Brittany, and say a few words. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I’ve been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don’t go, don’t come, don’t do anything. Today it was like, I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we’re doing very well in Oklahoma, that’s the word. That’s the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we’re going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we’ve done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that’s an all time record. That’s an all time record. I’ve always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we’re going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd.
And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they’re great. They are, they’re great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We’ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it’s submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it’s all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where’s my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he’s running, he’s great.
But we’ll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you’re a veteran, for years and years, they’ve wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you’re a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It’s never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that’s how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number.
And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn’t love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn’t get rid of them because they were, let’s say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let’s say, let’s just say. And so you couldn’t get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I’m going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you’re fired, get out, right? Get out.
They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it’s happening. It’s happening, I never knew it was so deep. It’s deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We’re lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I’ve been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I’m old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn’t lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He’s in Iowa and he says it’s good to be in Idaho. No, no, you’re in Iowa. He’s in New Hampshire and he says it’s great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you’re in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn’t happened to me yet. When that happens, there’s nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia.
I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That’s called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you’re going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child’s play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it’s called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody.
Our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left. We just saw it outside. We just saw it outside, you saw these thugs that came along. These people, call them protesters, isn’t it beautiful, it’s so beautiful. No, they’re so wonderful. They call them the Boston Tea Party. They’re so wonderful. Yeah, they call them  You ever watch fake news, CNN, you ever watch?
How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he’s standing in front of a building saying, "things are very peaceful here." And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I’ve ever seen. The whole town is burning. It’s like the biggest fire. And he said, "Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it’s great. These are wonderful people, Anderson." Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, "You got to get  you can’t protect yourselves." I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem.
And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn’t that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we’re not talking about some little place, we’re talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who’s radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I’d have an offer out, I said, "Anytime you want we’ll come in, we’ll straighten it out in one hour or less." Now I may be wrong, but it’s probably better for us to just watch that disaster.
I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we’re going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, "Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country." But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don’t complain. They’re incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don’t talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they’re not wearing their mask. You don’t hear their say, as they’re breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, "What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing."
But you don’t hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we  I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don’t ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don’t do it, don’t do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we’re terrible. And what we’ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany’s done a lot. South Korea has done a lot.
They called me, they said, the job you’re doing  Here’s the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don’t know what’s going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man’s 10-years-old. He’s got the sniffles. He’ll recover in about 15 minutes. That’s a case, add him to it. That’s okay. That’s a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he’s very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that’s amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us.
When you see a little kid running around say, "Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?" They don’t even know about this. Let’s open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We’re not conforming, that’s why we’re here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that.
And I heard it for the first time two weeks ago, I said, "Well, that one, I mean, they’re only kidding." I said, "They’re only, they’re not." Minneapolis, you what’s going on. They’re not kidding. They got a lot of problems. They’ll have a lot of problems. Hey, it’s 1:00 o’clock in the morning and a very tough, I’ve used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, "I’m sorry, this number’s no longer working." By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it’s a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you’re sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council’s already passed it. In Seattle, you see what’s going on there, it’s even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They’re crazy.
So if you want to save, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We’re a great country. You are so lucky I’m president, that’s all I can tell you.
USA! USA! USA! USA!
People have come up to me, say, "How do you take it?" I say, "Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we’re winning. And every once in a while, I’ll have one of these days where I’m hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, "Oh, it’s COVID." It’s this again. By the way, it’s a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, "Kung flu." I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, "Where do you get the energy?" I say, "I don’t have a choice. I don’t have a choice." It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might’ve seen it. So last week they called me and they say, "Sir, West Point, West Point, we’re ready." I said, "Oh, that’s right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point."
You know, they delayed it for six weeks because of COVID. So they delayed it and I went there. 1,106 cadets were graduated and beautiful. Beautiful. Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, "Sir, we’re ready to go." I say, "Let’s go." This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it’s beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, "Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am." So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don’t know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don’t know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay.
But they said to me before the speech, "Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there’ll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes." Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it’s like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought.
Helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought. So they fly over and the kids throw the hats in the air, it’s beautiful, it really is. It was a beautiful day and we’re all finished. I was on the stage for hours, hours, sun, I came home, I had a nice tan, meaning I had a nice sunburn. The sun’s like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I’m off by two minutes they’ll say, "He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he’s a liar." These people are sick, the fake news.
So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, "Thank goodness. Thank you very much." Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, "Sir, are you ready?" I said, "I’m ready General, where are we going now?" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it’s sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, " Sir, we can now leave the stage." I said, "Great general, let’s go, I’ll follow you," and he goes like this, "Right here, sir," and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, "General." Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They’re incredible, and they do. I said, "General, I’ve got myself a problem, general." Because I’m wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you’re walking on flat surfaces. It’s not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, "General, I have a problem," and he didn’t understand that at first. I said, "There’s no way." He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I’m being baked. I’m being baked like a cake. I said, "General, there’s no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing."
It’s true. So I said, "Is there like something else around?" "Sir, the ramp is ready to go." "Grab me sir, grab me." I didn’t really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, "That will be a story too." So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I’m rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really  It’s an ice skating rink, it’s brutal. So I said, "General, get ready because I may grab you so fast." Because I can’t fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It’s true, right? "I don’t want that, general." Now he’s standing there, big strong guy, and he’s got these shoes but they’re loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, "Okay, general, let’s go. I will only grab you if I need you. That’s not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn’t like that. I didn’t like this picture. This picture I’m sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, "General, I’m sorry," and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn’t want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, "Here was the number one trending story."
I call my wife, I said, "How good was that speech? I thought it was a " Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I’m average, but we’re having fun, we’re having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, "How good was it, darling?" She said, "You’re trending number one." I said to our great first lady, I said, "Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I’m trending number one? Because I felt it was really good." No no, they don’t even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson’s disease. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true.
They say there is something wrong with our president. I’ll let you know if there’s something wrong, okay? I’ll let you know if there’s something, I’ll tell you what, there’s something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you.
So then my wife said, "Well it wasn’t only the ramp. Did you have water?" I said, "Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn’t want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit." You’re drinking, you’re working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun’s like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That’s why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, "What does it have to do with water?" They said, "You couldn’t lift your hand up to your mouth with water." I said, "I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what’s the problem?" She said, "Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that’s sort of expensive." It’s silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don’t want to get water on the tie, and I don’t want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water.
I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? Where did it come from? I look down at my tie because I’ve done it. I’ve taken water and it spills down onto your tie, doesn’t look good for a long time and frankly, the tie is never the same. So I put it up to my lip and then I say, and they gave me another disease. They gave me another disease. Anyway, that’s a long story, but here’s the story. I have lived with more the ramp than the water but I have lived with the ramp and the water since I left West Point. Not one media group said I made a good speech or I made a great speech, but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier which wasn’t good in terms of COVID but they broke their barrier and they wanted to shake hands, they wanted to  I don’t want to tell anybody, but there were a couple of kids, they put out their hand, I actually shook their hand, okay? I actually shook them. Because they were excited. They were excited. They were with their president. They were excited. The most beautiful young people. Men, women, the most beautiful young people you’ve ever seen. So think of how you feel if you’re me. I go there, how did I do? "Sir, that was a great speech." You know all my people, "Sir, that was one of your best, that was great." I said, "That’s great, I agree, it was a good speech. I like that speech." They don’t mention the speech but they have been going down this ramp. It’s so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They’re bad people. Bad people.
Okay, that’s enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we’re getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn’t have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn’t do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we’re very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I’m a big believer in freedom of speech, but that’s desecration, that’s a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don’t have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist  Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, "Oh, the protesters were lovely." Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They’d have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they’ve done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they’re wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I’ll help you, I’ll do whatever you want. I’m waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it’ll take less than an hour and it’ll all be over with and you’ll have your city back.
Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he’s not confusing her with his sister? "Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy." That’s what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I’ll make like a speech and I’ll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn’t  It’ll say, "A comment from Joe Biden," but he didn’t say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they’ll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, "Joe didn’t say that. Joe doesn’t even understand it."
If Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters 100%. Your 401(k)s, by the way, look at how we’re doing in the stock market. Just set another record with NASDAQ. NASDAQ. Your 401(k)s and money itself will be worthless. Your 401(k)s are doing very well unless I don’t want to say  If you were stupid I’d say, "Don’t sell. Don’t sell. It went down." But we got it back up, and now NASDAQ, think of it. NASDAQ just set a record and I think you’re going to see a lot of records, and next year, if we don’t do anything stupid on November 3, you are going to have the greatest economic year we’ve ever had. That will be next year. If the Democrats gain power, than the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left, and he’s not radical left. I don’t think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he’s controlled by the radical left, and now he’s really controlled. His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. They bailed them out, they put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters, the looters and they were, they were the arsonists. They’ll say, "Oh, it’s terrible what he says about the people of our nation." Maybe some of them aren’t even from our nation. The leftists try to do everything they can to stop us. Every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem, they’ll do anything they can to stop us. Look what happened tonight. Look at what happened tonight. Law enforcement said, "Sir, they can’t be outside. It’s too dangerous." We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people. Our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side. Because I know our people. I know our people, but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation. What they did tonight, I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets. You open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions. It’s a great plane. Great everything. By the way, we ordered new ones. No president wanted to do it. They thought it was luxurious, wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don’t realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? "Sir, would you sign for this plane?" Now it’s actually two planes. "Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?" I said, "How old is the original or the one we have now?" "Sir, it’s 31, 32 years." I’d see people coming in from foreign lands that can’t compete with us, rich countries but they can’t compete with the  They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, "Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do "
So the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was $5.7 or $5.6 billion. Now in all fairness, it’s two planes and there’s a lot of stuff in those planes I won’t talk to you about. So I told Boeing, the head of Boeing, they said, "Sir, please, we’d like to get started on the planes," I said, "I do too, but I’m not paying $5.6 billion, and I’m not paying $4.6 billion." I said, " It has to have a three on the front of it." That’s a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation. They said, "No way." No way. This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing is coming back. They’re coming back. Greatest company of the world and that’s their big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn’t work out. That was terrible, but the greatest. I think before that, it was the greatest company in the world. It made up a quarter, one quarter of a point, of our GDP. Think how big that is, one company. It was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they’ve gone through hell but you know what? They’re coming back, we’re ready to help them if they need it but they’re coming back in the coming. This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we’re still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we’re going to win. We’re going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, "No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was." Whatever it was, if I’m a little bit off they’ll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, "Cancel the contract. I want it canceled." I said, "General, can you cancel the contract?" He said, "Yes sir, I’m very proud of it." "Oh good. Cancel it." "Okay sir." "By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?" "Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir." "How much is it, general?" "$250 million." I said, "What?" "Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill." "You mean if we don’t buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million." That’s not good, right? Look at these two guys, they’re looking.
By the way, that’s like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, "$250 million?" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I’m off by a little bit, they say, "Oh, he exaggerates." I look at numbers all day long. That’s what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great  I say, "General. Don’t cancel. Don’t cancel. Just tell them I don’t want the planes. Don’t put anything in writing, don’t put it in writing, general." "Why sir?" "Because I don’t want to pay 250." True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he’s great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job.
So here’s what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, "No way, no way, no way." The next week they say, "No way we’re doing it." The next week they said, "How about $5 billion?" I said, "No way. No way." The next week they said, "$4.8." I said, "Nope. It’s got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don’t you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don’t you understand?" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, "$4.5 is our best offer." "Nope. I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it. Come back when you’re ready." A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion.
That’s a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they’re not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, "Let’s get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they’re delinquent. For many years they’re delinquent. They haven’t been paying what they’re supposed to be paying. They’re paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number," and they say, "Yes, we think by
And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, "No, Angela, please. Don’t say that Angela. It’s true. You know who I’m talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, "Angela, that’s a long time," this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, "No Angela, that’s not working." But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, "Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn’t paid. I said, "What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?" So we’re negotiating let’s see, but in the meantime, we’re reducing our troops.
Remember this, we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we’re supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We’re supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don’t get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We’re ripped off by so many countries and we’re stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don’t want me here. They don’t want me. There are a lot of people that don’t want me. They don’t sell a lot of bombs when we’re not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It’s called the military industrial complex.
When rioting and looting broke out in our nation’s Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, "Get them in." After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We’re not happy. That’s going to be very expensive for DC. They’re always looking for money. "We need more money. We always need more money." And then they don’t do the proper job. So it’s not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there.
They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don’t worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn’t like what he said a week ago. I said, "Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody’s even asking?" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn’t like that. A lot of people that you wouldn’t even think would care that much. I’ve had people that I said, "These are super left liberals and they didn’t like it."
Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we’re doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody’s coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you’ve ever seen or ever heard.
Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they’re not looking to do you much help. ICE, they’re rough guys. they’re great Americans, but they’ll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They’ll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn’t say this, it’s not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody’s swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They’re great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth.
And when I called them animals, I said, "They’re animals." And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it’s more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, "These are animals." And Nancy Pelosi said, "These are human beings. They’re not animals." If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden’s America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that’s true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you’re seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don’t keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden’s record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what’s great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He’s been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden’s supported every globalist attack on the American worker let’s make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry.
Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, "We have to make this deal with South Korea. It’s going to mean 250,000 jobs." And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China’s entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens.
When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn’t know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn’t say it. And they didn’t cover it. They didn’t cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that’s closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That’s early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID.
When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He’ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That’s been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world’s top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn’t like it. You know why he didn’t like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn’t work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it’s a little bit
Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they’re okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time.
God bless you, Trump.
Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That’s incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that’s why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I’m going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you’ve ever seen. I’ve already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing.
And almost more incredible, he gave him 1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they’re not doing so well, are they? They’re not doing so well. Someday, we’re going to get credit for this, someday, but they are waiting. Iran wants to make a deal so badly. But they’re told by Carey and all these other, they shouldn’t the Logan Act, but they’re told Carey and all these people, "Wait, because if Trump loses you’ll own America, you’re going to own it." They’ll say you own it. So I don’t mind. I told them we can wait, but when I win, you’re going to pay a much higher price than if you made a deal.
I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son’s paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They’ll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that’s perfect and they’re not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don’t want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution.
They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you’re sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O’Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won’t have to think back about it too much, because it won’t matter. Hopefully it won’t matter. No, Beto O’Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that’s not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it’s never been before. And that’s after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far.
And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn’t have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it’s a, I don’t know if it’s an equal court, it’s almost like we’re a minority court, right? It’s almost like we’re a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We’ll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you’re the elite. They’re not the elite. You’re the elite.
Somebody two days ago said, "Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you." I said, "Yeah, why do you call them the elite," I said, "why?" "Well, they’re not elite." I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we’ll do it one more time. We won’t even toy with them about three or four more times. We won’t. We’ll do it one more time. We’ll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger.
But I’ll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I’ll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I’ll only pick from that list. Biden can’t release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn’t be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don’t understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, "You won, but you have to come back and redo it." It’s almost like, "Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good." But we’re going to be refiling, but don’t let it get you. Everything’s going to work out really good. Everything’s going to work out good.
It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, "Oh, you’re going to win DACA. You’re going to win DACA. That’s easy. You got to win DACA. That’s easy." They all said it. And they came back and they said, "We don’t like what you did with your paperwork," essentially. So we’re re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn’t lose. We’re going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren’t so young anymore, by the way. But we’re going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn’t even know where the hell he is. Let’s face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don’t think that’s going to work out too well, but she’s actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn’t even want to win. She doesn’t want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she’s got no sense, no credentials. She’s got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn’t have a clue. You know it. But she’s in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let’s cancel those brand new Air Force Ones.
Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don’t think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she’s telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we’re going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they’ve had it. They’ve had it.
Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man’s personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he’s never met. And he frankly probably doesn’t want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else’s jobs too by the way. If I didn’t come along, we’re building auto plants, we’re building everything. And there’s never been a comeback like we’re making right now. Never been.
He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn’t wanted to Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don’t-
And they don’t want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They’re not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They’ve done a terrible job and they shouldn’t be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn’t happen. It’ll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We’ve all worked too hard. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I’ve done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.
Racial justice begins with Joe Biden’s retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They’re respected by everybody. They do some job, and I’d have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He’s running on November 3rd. I don’t even know. Does he Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against There’s no competition that he’s got. I know he’s got James’ support. He’s got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I’d give it to James too, but he’s not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is.
Also here is a man who’s respected by so many. He’s a little bit right of the people we’ve been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people.
Patriot.
Thank you, Tom. Great job you’re doing. We’re glad to be joined as well by a man that I’ve gotten to know. He’s done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He’s been here for a little while. He’s done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don’t want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I’ll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they’ve done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible.
David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who’s got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They’re great They are, they’re warriors. I’ll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we’ll send Jim Inhofe back, and we’ll send all of them. You’ll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they’ve been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much.
So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I’m right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody’s ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we’re doing is we’re doing it again. And it’s going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don’t quite get it. We’re doing record business. It’s happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe.
Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here’s what’s going to happen. Here’s what’s going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn’t stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here’s what’s happening. We’re going up. We’re going up. We’re going up. We’re going to go up. Then we’re going to hit October. We’re going to be up. We’re going to be way up. We’re not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China.
But we’re going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, "Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he’s doing. I don’t believe the fake news anymore." And you’re not going to want to lose your 401k’s. And you’re not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you’ve accumulated, whether it’s real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it’ll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I’m not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we’re going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we’re going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we’ve ever had, okay?
And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don’t have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don’t have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, "Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don’t think I want to take a chance." You’re not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it’s the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, "Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor." And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? "Darling, I love you so much. You’ve always been a loser. You’ve always lost money. But now under President Trump, you’re one of the greatest financial minds in our country." And all you did was keep your stock.
Now, if you think you’re going to run against Oh, they’re going crazy. They want the stock market to go down. Even if it costs them money, they want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money, and they don’t even know why. You know what, they’re smart and they’re vicious, but they don’t know why. I’m telling you, they don’t know why. What’s wrong with having the strongest military brand new in the world? What’s wrong with having these great economic numbers? What’s wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let’s go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He’s a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it’s time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work.
I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they’ve never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I’m also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we’re going to do that. It’ll be done very quickly.
We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It’s very popular, but some people it’s like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it’s wrong.
Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It’s a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that’s over 30%. They’re controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats’ push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you’d never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening, that’s what’s happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they’d see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we’ll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful.
212 mile. That’s a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there’s something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, "Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone." I said, "Thank you very much."
And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It’s so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That’s happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn’t President, would have never come. We will become the world’s premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That’s already started. We’re bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America’s terrorist enemies.
When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. "Sir, we’ve just taken 100%." We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it’s damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn’t sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we’ll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, "In God we trust." We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.
and the upcoming Arbor Day and that’s going to be Tell me David. That’s right. Friday. Thank you. As more than 180 nations around the world battle the vicious coronavirus, we continue to mourn the precious souls who have been lost, so sadly lost, and so unnecessarily lost. It should have been stopped and it should’ve been stopped right where it started, and everyone knows where it started.
But in this time of trial, the beauty of springtime fills us with the peace and the hope of renewal. We’re pleased to be joined by our great Vice President, Mike Pence. Please Mike, stand up. You have done such a great job on getting us open again. We’re opening again, Mike. It’s starting to move. A lot of states are in great shape and they’re starting to move it along. And very importantly, Karen Pence has been so fantastic and done such a great job representing the country. Thank you, Karen. Beautiful job.
Also here are Secretaries David Bernhardt, Sonny Perdue, Administrator Wheeler, Andrew Wheeler. Thank you. And Leader, Kevin McCarthy, and what a job he’s done and good vote the other day, yesterday. That was good. But previous to that. And when are you voting on the.
To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a National Emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to 50 billion dollars of very important and a large amount of money for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.
In furtherance of the order, I’m urging every state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world. They’re standing right behind me and the side of me. I’m also asking every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also various engaged. I just spoke with governor Cuomo. We had a very good conversation and we’re working very strongly with the many states including New York.
The urgency orders I’m issuing today will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately wave revisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospital all hospitals and healthcare providers, maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients. This includes the following critical authorities, the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that’s happened in the not so distant past. I tell you what they’ve done with telehealth has incredible. It gives remote doctors visits and hospital check-ins the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services in states with the greatest need.
Number two, the ability to waive requirements that critical access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours. The ability to waive the requirements of a three day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home; big thing. The authority to waive rules to hinder hospital’s ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. They can do as they want. They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don’t have any problem getting it done.
The authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital itself. Ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established. We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to. No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever. 10 days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on the solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests.
Other countries have called us and worked with us and they’re doing similar things or will be doing similar things as a result of that action. Today we are announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the Coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently but we don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it and we don’t want everyone running out and taking; only if you have certain symptoms.
Using federal emergency authorities, the FDA approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We’ll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night. I want to thank Roche, great company for their incredible work. I’d also like to thank Thermo Fisher. The FDA’s goal is to hopefully authorize your application within 24 hours. It’ll go very quickly. It’s going very quickly. Which will bring additionally 1.4 million tests on board next week and five million within a month. I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.
At the same time, we’ve been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car. I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. And we have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover this country and large parts of the world, by the way. We’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country.
Stores in virtually every location. Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don’t want everybody taking this test. It’s totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through and we’re going to be even stronger for it. We’ve learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned. I want to thank Deborah Birx and I want to ask her maybe to come up and say a few words as to what’s happening. Dr. Birx is a highly respected person. I’ve gotten to know her very well over the last six days and what we’ve done is we built something that was very old, very old fashioned, somewhat obsolete, certainly obsolete when it comes to the kind of numbers that we’re talking about. Dr. Birx, please. Thank you, Deborah.
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens, three years ago we launched the great American comeback. Tonight I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging and our country is thriving and highly respected again. America’s enemies are on the run. America’s fortunes are on the rise and America’s future is blazing bright. The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.
In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of American’s destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never ever going back. I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world and it’s not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress, the state of our union is stronger than ever before. The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society. One where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise. From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the US economy, slashing a record number of job killing regulations, enacting historic and record setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and most of all pro-American. Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion and creed very, very high.
Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration. The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success. The unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72% of all new jobs added. The veteran’s unemployment rate dropped to a record low. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in US history. A record number of young Americans are now employed. Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.
In eight years, under the last administration, over 300,000 working age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people, working age people, have joined the workforce. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low income workers who have seen a 16% pay increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom. Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.
Since my election, US stock markets have soared 70%, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record, it is something that every country in the world is looking up to, they admire. Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs. All of those millions of people with 401ks and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100% and even more. Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods, thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott, as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It’s all working. Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran, Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house and his family. He was homeless, but then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug free, reunited with his family and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony. Thank you Tony.
Our roaring economy has for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed Landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done and the people in this room got it done. Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago. Likewise, we are restoring our nations manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never ever be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built. Companies are not leaving, they are coming back to the USA. The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is.
One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA as adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high paying American auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.
It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level. But also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity, we will have that fairness and reciprocity. And I say that finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions. I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of America’s jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China, that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but at the same time we have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever had with China, including with president Xi. They respect what we’ve done because quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, "That’s enough." Now we want to rebuild our country and that’s exactly what we’re doing. We are rebuilding our country. As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That’s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59 nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people, but Maduro’s grip tyranny will be smashed and broken.
Here this evening, is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guido, Mr. President, please take this message back to your opponent. Thank you, Mr. President, a great honor. Thank you very much. Please take this message back that all Americans are United with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much Mr. President. Thank you very much. Socialism destroys nations, but always remember freedom unifies the soul.
To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rocket ships, and every other form of military equipment and it’s all made right here in the USA. We’re also getting our allies finally, to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from other NATO members by more than $400 billion and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand new branch of the United States armed forces. It’s called the Space Force. It’s very important.
In the gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman and what he wants so badly 13 years old, Iain Lanphier. He’s an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, "Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world." But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all, Charles McGee, who was born in Cleveland Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee airman, the first black fighter pilots, and
Eggy Airman, the first black fighter pilots, and he also happens to be Ian’s great grandfather. Incredible story. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our nation salutes you. Thank you sir. From the pilgrims to the founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future. Members of Congress we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.
The people are the heart of our country. Their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first.
The next step forward and building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students 18 States have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships. The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list. One of those students is Jenaya Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia, Jenaya.
Jenaya’s mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future, but last year that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children. Jenaya and Stephanie are in the gallery. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. Thank you very much.
But Jenaya I have some good news for you because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announced tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available. It’s going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice. Now I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity, Jenaya has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act because no parents should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow. For this reason, our magnificent first lady has launched The Be Best initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive and drug free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children. Thank you very much. My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our pledge to American workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans. My budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation’s high schools. Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America. To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation’s historically black colleges and universities. A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative and high quality healthcare system on earth. Before I took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better. I’ve also made an Ironclad Pledge to American families. We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security, always.
The American patients should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care, but as we work to improve Americans health care, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know we will never let socialism destroy American healthcare.
Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. That is what is happening in California and other States. Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal alien sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical Left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens.
This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded Southern border where as we speak, a long, tall and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed. My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before.
And I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years, the costs of prescription drugs actually went down. And working together Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I’ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done quickly and properly. I’m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk and I will sign it into law immediately. With unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit Ohio is down 22%, Pennsylvania is down 18%, Wisconsin is down 10%, and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.
Protecting Americans health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Corona virus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat. We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health. And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade.
Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage four advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. And Rush in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, The Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the first lady of the United States to present you with the honor. Please. Rush and Catherine, congratulations. Thank you, Catherine.
As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017 doctors at Saint Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and six days and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter. Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life. Today Ellie is a strong, healthy two year old girl sitting with her amazing mother, Robin in the gallery, Ellie and Robin we’re glad to have you with us tonight. Ella reminds us that every child is a miracle of life and thanks to modern medical wonders. 50% of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. It’s an incredible thing. Thank you very much.
Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I’m asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America’s youngest patients. That is why I’m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion of babies.
Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God. As we support America’s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce, paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on Congress to pass the bipartisan advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation. 40 million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit.
I’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare, enabling 17 States to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether. And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.
To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the 1 Trillion Tree Initiative and ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world.
We must also rebuild America’s infrastructure. I asked you to pass Senator John Barrasso’s Highway Bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land. I’m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high speed Internet, including and especially in rural America. A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation’s heroic ICE officers.
Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2000 murders. Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In sanctuary cities local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE’s detainer requests, his victim would still be alive today.
The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants, a very terrible sanctuary with catastrophic results. Here is just one tragic example. In December, 2018 California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault, but as required by California sanctuary law, local authorities released him. Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He
Ellian went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work. He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims is a terrible, terrible situation, died 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him and cold blood.
Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything else in the world. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody? Thank you.
Jody, our hearts weep for your lost and we will not rest until you have justice. Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices.
I asked Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal alien.
In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers and I have side nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking domestically and all around the globe. My administration has undertaken and unprecedented effort to secure the Southern border of the United States
Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our Southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again. My administration has ended catch and release.
If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country.
Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75% since May dropping eight straight months in a row.
And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise and the border crossings are going down and going down very rapidly. Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisoners narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of border patrol and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz, please stand.
A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of border patrol and ICE. Thank you very much. Thank you. To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.
With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom.
Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, thank you, Mitch, and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. And we have many in the pipeline.
My administration is also defending religious liberty and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools.
In America, we don’t punish prayer. We don’t tear down crosses. We don’t band symbols of faith. We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of God. Just as we believe in the first amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am president, I will always protect your second amendment right to keep and bear arms.
In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.
My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.
Last week, I announced the groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future. Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100% destroyed and the founder and leader of ISIS, the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi is dead.
We are joined this evening by Carl and Marcia Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. She once wrote, some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love. I find God in suffering. I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering. In 2013 while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself.
After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla. She was just 26-years-old. On the night that US Special Forces operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley received a call in the situation room. He was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name task force 814. It was a reference to a special day, August 14, Kayla’s birthday. Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla and neither will we. Thank you. Every day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart. One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage, I will be with you again. He wrote to gage. I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sandbox, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son. Take care of your mother. I am always with you. Daddy.
On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington and his wife Kelly is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well. To Kelly and Gage, Chris will live in our hearts forever. He’s looking down on you now. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you both very much. The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life. Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murder or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women and children. He directed the December assault and went on to assault US forces in Iraq, was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard. And that’s why last month at my direction, the US military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.
Our message to the terrorists is clear. You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life. In recent months, we have seen prouder radians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short time recovery.
It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let’s see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.
As we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s Wars in the Middle East. In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our war fighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress and peace talks are now underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies. These are war fighters that we have, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.
We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home. War places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina and her two children, six-year-old Eliana and three-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband’s Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months.
Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy. But, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much. As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. There’s a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo. The beautiful, beautiful Alamo. The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown, tamed the wilderness, settled the wild West, lifted millions from poverty, disease and hunger, vanquished tyranny and fascism, ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine, laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers and ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history and we are making it greater than ever before. This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world. We built the modern world and we change history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of almighty God. America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true. This nation is our canvas and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American age, the American epic, the American adventure has only just begun.
Our spirit is still young. The sun is still rising. God’s grace is still shining. And my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.
Over the last five or six years, China’s made $500-billion. 500-billion. Ripped it out of the United States. And not only that, if you take a look, intellectual property theft, add that to it and add a lot of other things to it. So, somebody Excuse me. Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it. So, I’m taking on China. I’m taking it on China on trade. And you know what? We’re winning because we’re the piggy bank. We’re the one that all these countries, including the European union, wants to rob and takes advantage of. But I’d need a letter from the attorney general
So, the fake news of which many of you are members is trying to convince the public to have a recession. Let’s have a recession. The United States is doing phenomenally well, but one thing I have to do is economically take on China because China has been ripping us off for many years. President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama and others should have done this long before me. My life would be much easier Although I enjoy doing it, but my life would be much easier if I just said, "Let China continue to rip off the United States." All right? It’d be much easier, but I can’t do that. We are winning against China. They’ve lost two and a half million jobs in a very short period of time. They want to make a deal. It’s got to be a deal that’s good for the United States where they want to make it deal. Probably, we will make a deal. But if I didn’t do that, and I’m not doing Somebody said it’s Trump’s trade war. This isn’t my trade war. This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents.
Over the last five or six years, China’s made $500-billion. 500 billion. Ripped it out of the United States. And not only that, if you take a look, intellectual property theft, add that to it and they had a lot of other things do it. So, somebody Excuse me. Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it. So, I’m taking it on China. I’m taking on China on trade. And you know what? We’re winning. Because we’re the piggy bank. We’re the one that all these countries, including the European union, wants to Rob and takes advantage. European union, $200-billion. China, more than $500-billion.
Sorry. I was put here by people to do a great job and that’s what I’m doing. And nobody’s done a job like I’ve done. Now, would China rather wait for a little more than a year and try and get sleepy Joe Biden to negotiate with instead of President Trump? Maybe, but I don’t think so. You know why? They’re losing too many jobs too fast. They had the worst year in 27 years, but I think it was actually 52 or 54 years. It was the worst year they’ve had in a half a century, and that’s because of me. And I’m not proud of that. But you know what? They want to negotiate, sleepy Joe doesn’t have a clue. Sleepy Joe said, "Oh, China’s wonderful." Well, China is wonderful for China, but I’m wonderful for the USA.
Good morning. My fellow Americans, this morning our nation is overcome with shock, horror, and sorrow. This weekend, more than 80 people were killed or wounded in two evil attacks. On Saturday morning in El Paso, Texas, a wicked man went to a Walmart store where families were shopping with their loved ones. He shot and murdered 20 people and injured 26 others, including precious little children. Then in the early hours of Sunday morning, Dayton, Ohio, another twisted monster opened fire on a crowded downtown street. He murdered nine people, including his own sister, and injured 27 others.
The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, and the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands, and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen. We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful, and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve.
I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes. I have spoken with Texas governor Greg Abbott and Ohio governor Mike DeWine, as well as Mayor Dee Margo of El Paso, Texas and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio to express our profound sadness and unfailing support. Today we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico and all the people of Mexico for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting. Terrible, terrible thing. I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Wray. Federal authorities are on the ground, and I have directed them to provide any and all assistance required, whatever is needed.
The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Whatever they need. We must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts. We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The internet likewise is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution, and so many other heinous crimes. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored.
In the two decades since Columbine, our nation has watched with rising horror and dread as one mass shooting has followed another, over and over again, decade after decade. We cannot allow ourselves to feel powerless. We can and will stop this evil contagion. In that task, we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real bipartisan solutions, we have to do that in a bipartisan manner, that will truly make America safer and better for all.
First, we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike. As an example, the monster in the Parkland High School in Florida had many red flags against him, and yet nobody took decisive action. Nobody did anything. Why not?
Second, we must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life. That’s what we have to do.
Third, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence, and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement. Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.
Fourth, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Today, I’m also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay.
These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference. Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety, and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses.
But there is so much more that we have to do. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside, so destructive, and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion, and love. Our future is in our control. America will rise to the challenge. We will always have, and we always will, win. The choice is ours and ours alone. It is not up to mentally ill monsters. It is up to us. If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain.
Well thank you very much, and thank you Gretchen. It’s great to be back in the incredible Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Great place. And this is my 13th visit to Pennsylvania during my administration, which is more than any other president to this point in the term. And I really love Pennsylvania, I went to school in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia. So we love this state, and I love the unions, and I love the workers. And you know, when I built buildings in New York, I built them exclusively with union, people don’t understand that. I was exclusive.
And in the last really great election, our election of 2016, you know, we did great with the union workers, great. But we didn’t do good with the leadership. The leadership said, "Well, we’ve always gone Democrat. Let’s keep going that way." That didn’t work out too well for some of them, I want to tell you. I’ll tell you, and as Gretchen said, this would have never happened without me and us. This would have never happened. So I’m with you. I’m with you. Remember that.
And remember that Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania has the best numbers they’ve ever had in the history of the state, and that’s for a very good reason. And you know what that reason is? Hello, here I am. And I’m truly honored to be here with the amazing energy workers and construction workers. These are talented people, the craft workers who make America run and who make America proud. We’re proud again. We’re proud again.
And no one in the world does it better than you, nobody. Nobody does it better. There’s nobody in the world that does it. And we’re unleashing that power again like we’ve never seen before, I will say. And we are doing well, and we’re fighting against a lot of countries that have taken advantage of us for many, many years, but they’re not doing it so much anymore. And in a little period of time, they won’t be doing it at all anymore. They’ve taken advantage of this country.
Today we celebrate the revolution in American energy that’s helping make our economy the envy of the world. This shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, I did very well here. We did very well. How many points did we win by? Does anybody know? I’ll tell you. Isn’t it, I think 28 points, that’s a lot. That’s against a Democrat  or whatever.
It’s one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation and it made it possible and was possible by clean, affordable, all American natural gas. Powerful, clean, natural gas. And when the wind stops blowing, it doesn’t make any difference does it? Unlike like those big windmills that destroy everybody’s property values, kill all the birds. Someday the environmentalists are going to tell us what’s going on with that. And then all of a sudden it stops, the wind, and the televisions go off. And your wives and husbands say, "Darling, I want to watch Donald Trump on television tonight, but the wind stopped blowing and I can’t watch, there’s no electricity in the house, Darling.".
Now we love natural gas, and we love a lot of other things too. Each of you has taken part in the largest investment in Pennsylvania history. It’s the largest investment in the history of Pennsylvania, in the history of our country, the money that’s being invested in your state right now. With your help, we’re not only unleashing American energy, we’re restoring the glory of American manufacturing, and we are reclaiming our noble heritage as a nation of builders again. A nation of builders.
I was a good builder, I built it, I love building. In fact, I’m going to take a tour of the site. They said, "Sir, we were going to do it before the speech, but we’re waiting for it to stop raining." I said, "Don’t worry about the rain. Do we have umbrellas? Don’t worry about the rain." Umbrellas work very well, especially when they are made in America.
So I don’t care, but we’re gonna take a tour afterwards. I’m going to speak to some of your union leaders to say, I hope you’re going to support Trump. Okay? And if they don’t vote them the hell out of office because they’re not doing their job, it’s true. Vote them out of office.
When completed, this facility will transform abundant natural gas, and we have a lot of it, fracked from Pennsylvania wells, which they never would have allowed you to take if I weren’t president. If my opponent won, this would be a lot of nice new structures outside, I guess you would have stopped long ago. You would have stopped construction before it started too much. But I was talking to Gretchen, they would’ve never gotten the approvals to do what’s needed to fuel these plans. That wouldn’t have been good, so probably they wouldn’t have started, but if they would have started, it would have been stopped. But they put it into plastic through a process known as cracking. That raw material will then be shipped all over the country and all over the world to be fashioned into more products stamped with that very beautiful phrase, "Made in the USA." Right? Made in the USA. Beautiful.
That is a beautiful phrase. Getting this massive job done right, has required more than 1,500 pieces of heavy equipment, one of the largest cranes anywhere in the world. I look forward to seeing it, I love cranes. I love trucks of all types. Even when I was a little boy at four years old, my mother would say, "You love the trucks." I do. I always loved trucks, I still do, nothing changes. Sometimes, you know, you might become president, but nothing changes, I still love trucks. Especially when I look at the largest crane in the world, that’s very cool. Do you think I’ll get to operate it? I don’t know. We’ll put the media on it and I’ll give then a little ride. Right?
And you have thousands of tons of concrete, aluminum, and steel and nearly 6,000 of the strongest, toughest, and most talented workers anywhere on earth. It’s true. I know. It was the Trump administration that made it possible, no one else. Without us, you would never have been able to do this. I want to thank all of our great union members, the boiler makers, carpenters, cement finishers, electricians, iron workers, laborers, millwrights, operators, plumbers, painters, steam fitters, I know them well.
And a group that I’ve used more than anybody that’s ever run for office times a thousand. Because in New York City they would drive those cement trucks up to my building, and those trucks were always on time, and sometimes they were lined up for six blocks when I was doing different things. Even when I was doing the Wollman Rink the city couldn’t build, it took them nine years, they had no idea what they were doing. And I had that whole, big, about 70,000 feet. It’s like a massive office floor, bigger than an office. Look, we did it all in one day and the trucks were lined up from Central Park all the way back into Harlem. And they did it all in one day.
That pour, it was called a contiguous pour, the city used to build little pieces, a little piece here, a little piece there, little piece here, little piece there. A few years later, a little piece here. Then they had pipes underneath, and the pipes were made out of copper. And during the evening things would happen, like the copper would be stolen because it was very valuable. So they’d have a little piece with copper and then the rest of the pipe they’d lay and they’d get ready to pour, and they’d leave and everybody would steal the copper. So they’d  this took place for  I guess from seven to nine years, nobody actually knows, nobody wants to talk about it. But those trucks were operated incredibly well and I never missed a delivery and it’s called the teamsters.
I also wanna thank Bechtel, a real incredible company. We talk about the great builders of the world, President Jack Future. Where is he? Where is he? Jack? Where is Jack? Jack? What a great job you’ve done, Jack. Some big ones. Think of it this way, Jack, if we don’t win, you won’t be doing anything in this country. And you know the world follows us, you see that. The world follows us. And it won’t be so good. But you and I are friends and you’re going to have a lot of work to do, I think Jack, a lot of work. Thank you, Jack. Great job. Jack has done an incredible job. That’s an incredible company. Incredible. They’re incredible builders.
And the Secretary Treasurer of North America is building trades unions, Brent Booker, where’s Brent? Brent, thank you, great job. Young guy. You’re so young, Brent. How the hell did you get that job? Man.
We’re honored to be joined by two leaders who truly have the backs of American workers. They’ve become friends of mine, they do such an incredible job. They break up the roadblocks. We have a lot of roadblocks in this country where you have  a little clause can stop a project, a little clause can stop it for years. And we break up those little clauses, we break them up fast. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Where’s Rick? Rick. Thank you, Rick. Another great guy. I had to compete with him. You know, he wanted to be president. He was tough, he was nasty. Man. He was nasty. But then he said, "I want to do something great", and you have been incredible. He ran Texas for like 14 years. And he did it well and now he’s running a little thing called energy and nobody’s ever done it better. Thank you, Rick, very much. Great job.
And a man who has been incredible in every way. You know, EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, you’ve heard a lot of horror stories where nothing can get done, nothing gets passed. It takes years, and years, and years to get a simple permit. It can take 20, 21 years to get a road before they reject it. How about this? They go 20 years, 21 years in certain cases for a highway or road, not even a highway. At the end of the 21st year they vote to reject it. How would you like to be, you’re a young person, you’re starting out, and you’re all excited about this project, and it starts off as being a simple straight road. And then it ends up being a total catastrophe. Because of nesting and lots of other things that we can take care of. And it’s 20 years later, and then they reject it. You’ve devoted half of your working life to a rejection. Happened to many people. And we have a man that knows how to break it up, but he’s also a great lover of the environment, EPA Administrator, Andrew Wheeler. He’s done an incredible job. Andrew, great job, Andre. Really great job.
And I also want to recognize some of my great friends that have helped me so much. Congressman John Joyce. John? John? Where is John? John. John, usually you’re in the front row, I can’t believe this. I guess you got shut out by the unions. Thank you John. Fantastic job, John Joyce. Been a great friend, a great friend of all of us.
Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Michael Turzai. Michael Turzai. Thank you, Michael, great job. Thank you. Good to see you, Michael. Michael Turzai. Great name in this state, I’ll tell you, for a long time. How long has it been, Michael, you’ve been there a long time. How long? Okay, good luck. Not that long. Thank you Mike.
And one of my good friends from Beaver County, David Urban. David. David, where’s David? David, thank you, David. Great football player, great athlete. And he was a Trump supporter, he liked Trump. And when he liked Trump, nobody was going to get in his way. Right, David? Thank you. Thank you. How are we doing in this state, David? We looking good? Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. I think we’re looking very good. I think we’re looking good all over in Ohio, in North Carolina and South Carolina, Florida. We just got numbers in Florida. We’re looking fantastically good.
Now, you know, sometimes  And they do, they do, they say "Donald Trump". Can you imagine if I got a fair press? I mean, we’re leading without it, can you imagine if these people treated me fairly? The election would be over. Have they ever called off an election before? Just said, "Look, just  let’s go, go on, four more years."
Yeah. And then you want to really drive them crazy, go to hashtag third term, hashtag fourth term. You’ll drive them totally crazy. I mean, you have one guy on television, I’m telling you he’s not leaving. He’s going to win. And then he’s not leaving. So in 2024 he won’t leave, I’m telling you, this is a serious person. These people have gone stone cold crazy.
And we’re grateful, especially to chairman of Royal Dutch Shell. That’s big stuff, folks. You know, I’m a business guy, When I hear Royal Dutch Shell, until I became president, that was like a big deal. But now I don’t feel it the same. Once you’re president, nothing seems big. Right? Chad Holiday. Where’s Chad? Chad understands. That’s a big deal, Chad. And thank you for coming. That’s a big deal. You don’t get any bigger. It’s an incredible company.
Shell’s US president, you just met her and you know her, everybody knows her. And she’s got a lot of other things in store, and she’s thanked me for what we’ve done here, but I said, "Forget this. We’ve got a lot of jobs. Let’s do a couple of more fast. Do them fast, we’ll get your fast approvals," and you may get rejected. You know, if it’s not going to be environmentally good, environmentally sound, if something’s going to be wrong, but we’re not going to take 20 years to reject you like they did with the pipelines. Doesn’t matter, I approved them, but that’s okay. So we have pipe  Oh. We’ve got plenty of pipeline folks here, don’t we? Ah, I’d say.
Hey. You know, that’s a bigger hand than we got from the Teamsters, you believe that? Now, but you know they did that with the pipelines, right? Keystone XL, they did it with the pipelines. Dakota Access Pipeline, we’re building pipelines, and if we get the pipelines approved then you better work. The EPA is working right now to get them approved and Texas said, "If we can do, we can increase our  we can increase," we’re now the largest in the world in energy by far.
But if we get those approved, Andrew, I hope Andrew’s listening, EPA, Andrew, you know what I’m saying, right? If we get them approved in Texas fast, they said it will take 18 years. I said, "Could you do it in about a month?" If we get the  Oh look at those pipeline guys, they’re so happy. That’s a lot of jobs. But Andrew, if we get them approved fast, we can increase our entire output. Texas is so big and is bigger, it turned out to be much bigger. I also got you ANWR in Alaska, which may be bigger than everything. And they couldn’t get it. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it, no president could get it, and I got it approved and we’re all set. And so Andrew in Texas, if you can get those pipelines going, you will be so happy. We’ll have dinner with your family. I’ll tell them how great you were. Okay, EPA. Thank you, Andrew.
So I want to  I want to thank though Gretchen, she’s been fantastic. I also want to thank Vice President of Pennsylvania Chemicals, Hillary Mercer. I want to thank you very much for investing in the people of Pennsylvania. Hillary? Where’s Hillary? Thank you, Hillary. You’re investing in the people of Pennsylvania, so that’s a guarantee, as far as I’m concerned.
America greatness was forged and fueled and won by the extraordinary workers of this region. This region is an incredible region. Pennsylvania steel raised the skyscrapers that built our cities, and by the way, steel, steel was dead. Your business was dead. Okay? I don’t want to be overly crude. Your business was dead. And I put a little thing called a 25% tariff on all of the dump steel all over the country, and now your business is thriving. Probably there’s few businesses that have gone proportionately up like steel and aluminum. We did it with aluminum too, but they are doing well, 25% and 10% on aluminum.
doing well, 25% and 10% on aluminum, and they still dump, but now the United States takes in billions of dollars, and the dumping is much less, and the steel companies are thriving again. We have to have a steel industry. We need steel for defense. What are we going to do? We have a little bit of a problem. We have a little bit of a conflict. We’ll say, "Listen, China, could you do us a favor? We need to help. All our steel mills are closed, Oh, dammit. Could you send us some steel, please? We don’t make seal anymore.".
Well, we make it now, and I’ll tell you what, those steel mills, US Steel and all of them, all of them, they’re expanding all over the place. New mills, new expansions. We didn’t have a new mill built in 30 years, and now we have many of them going up. Many car plants, they’re coming in from Japan. I told Prime Minister Abe, great guy. I said, listen, we have a massive deficit with Japan. They send thousands and thousands, millions of cars, we send them wheat. Wheat. That’s not a good deal.
And they don’t even want our wheat. They do it because they want us to at least feel that we’re okay. You know, they do it to make us feel good, but the deficit is massive, which changing rapidly. But what they’re doing is they’re buying a lot of our stuff, including our military equipment. They are building car plants now in the United States, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, many, many of the Japanese car companies are coming over and building car plants in the United States. It doesn’t fully do the trip, but it helps. And those deficits will start coming down very substantially, but we’re losing 78 billion. For many years, we’re losing billions and billions with these countries, and frankly, the countries that we do the worst with are the allies, our allies. Does that make sense to you? Our allies take advantage of us far greater than our enemies, and someday I’m going to explain that to a lot of people.
Pennsylvania miners. Do we love our miners? They lit up our towns and powered our industries, and Pennsylvania factory workers made the American brand into the universal symbol of excellence all around the world, all over. But in recent decades, the loyalty of Pennsylvania workers was repaid only with betrayal. They betrayed you. They let your companies move to Mexico, to Canada, to China, to many other places. We ended up with no income and massive unemployment. Well, right now our employment has reached the lowest level that it’s seen since the 1960s and we’ll soon be breaking that record, I predict.
And you’ve heard me say it, but now it’s even better. Numbers just came out. African American unemployment, lowest in history, Asian American, Hispanic American, lowest in the history of our country. Women lowest in 70 years. Sorry women, I let you down again. Think of it, lowest in 70 years, and I have to apologize to women, but soon we’re going to have that. That will be a record very soon. We’re very close to saying lowest in history for women unemployment. Today we have more workers working in the United States, almost 160 million, than at any time in the history of our country. Think of that. That’s a hell of a stat. The political class in Washington gutted your factories with horrendous trade deals, horrible. NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. By the way, World Trade Organization, it made China, China made themselves, they did a good job, but they ripped off our country for years, and with our money and World Trade Organization backing, and then they took advantage of the rules of the World Trade Organization, and I’m being nice when I say took advantage. Much more than took advantage.
They went up like a rocket ship. They were flat lined for a hundred years, and then one day World Trade Organization, a terrible move, and we were losing all our cases until I came along. We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. Almost every case were lost, lost, lost. They thought we were stupid. They were the ones ruling. And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases, because they know that they’re not on very solid ground. We will leave if we have to, and all of a sudden we’re winning a lot of cases. We’re winning most of our cases, and it’s only because of attitude, because we know that they have been screwing us for years, and it’s not going to happen any longer. They get it, they get it. So they’re giving us victories. They’re giving us victories.
I’d like to use a different word, but there’s no word that’s quite as  Right? There’s no word that’s quite as descriptive. I’d like to, but that’s exactly what they were doing. They were taking advantage of us for years and years, and now they understand that if it’s not going to be fair, it’s not going to be at all. We don’t need it, we don’t need it. So a lot of good things, and I think we will, I think they will treat us fairly. I mean the concept should work, but people have taken advantage. Like for instance, they view certain countries like China, India, many countries for a long time, they viewed them as they’re growing, right? They’re growing nations. We’re a mature nation. They’re growing. These are growing nations. Well, they’ve grown, and they had tremendous advantages, but we’re not letting that happen anymore, okay? We’re not letting that happen anymore.
Everybody’s growing but us. They’re all growing nations. We have to work with them, but nobody ever wants to work with the United States. It’s a disgrace. But it’s changing, and it’s changing fast, and I think it’s the primary reason probably that I ran for president. I’d see these factories all over the country, and I’d see them empty, and I’d see the jobs going to other countries, and I just never understood why the politicians didn’t do anything about it. But now we’re doing it. And by the way, the USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, that deal is a fantastic deal, and it’s a great deal for your unions, too. We have the farmers, the unions, the manufacturers. It’s good for everybody. We have to get the Democrats to put it up for a vote, and most Democrats are going to vote for it, too. They’re under a lot of pressure to vote for it, but that replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made, which is NAFTA.
But I watched them crush your industries with taxes and regulations, and they targeted American energy for total destruction. You weren’t going to be able to take anything out. That’s our gold. That’s gold underneath their feet, and they weren’t going to allow it to happen. The Paris Accord, the Paris Accord was good for other countries, wasn’t good for us. All the while they expected you to stay on the sidelines, silence your voices, and surrender the future of our nation, and you didn’t do it, but you didn’t have the right people representing you, so it didn’t matter. But when you finally had the right person, the person that really cared  This thing is costing me a fortune, being president. Somebody said, "Oh, he might’ve rented a room to a man from Saudi Arabia for $500." What about the 5 billion that I’ll lose?
It’s probably gonna cost me, including upside downside lawyers, because every day they sue me for something. These are the most litigious people. It’s probably costing me from three to 5 billion for the privilege of being, and I couldn’t care less. I don’t care. You know, if you’re wealthy, it doesn’t matter. I just want to do a great job. That’s why I don’t care. I want to do the right job. When this great building company comes here, wants to build a plant, I want to make it easy for them, not hard for them. I’m not jealous of them. I couldn’t care less. I’m not jealous of them.
I got sued on a thing called emoluments. Emoluments, you ever hear the word? Nobody ever heard of it before. They went back. Now nobody looks at Obama getting $60 million for a book. That’s okay, even though nobody in history ever got that much money for a book. Obama got 60. Think of it, $60 million for a book. But with me, it’s everything. Emoluments. Nobody knows what it is. Here’s the good news. Last month I just won two cases on emoluments, and the judge was scolding of the other side. And what it is, is presidential harassment, because this thing is costing me a fortune and I love it. Okay? I love it because I’m making the lives of other people much, much better.
Each of you here today is living proof that America never surrenders. We don’t surrender. And we were in bad shape. This area was in really bad shape, and now you look outside and you say, that’s like the eighth wonder of the world. Under my administration, we’re fighting back, and we’re winning because we are truly and finally putting America first. After years of building up foreign countries, we are finally building up our country. Think of it, we protect the border of South Korea, but we don’t protect our own border. But now we are and the wall is being built. We won that case two weeks ago. We won that case. The wall is being  We’re going to have a lot of it. We’re going to have anywhere from 400 to 500 miles built by the end of next year. We’re building a lot of wall, and we need it. We need it. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally, and we want them to come in through merit. The last administration tried to shut down Pennsylvania coal and Pennsylvania fracking. If they got in, your fracking is gone. Your coal is gone. You guys, I don’t know what the hell you going to do. You don’t want to make widgets, right? Do you want to learn how to make a computer, a little tiny piece of stuff you put it with those big, beautiful hands of yours?
Take these big hands, he’s going to take this little tiny part. He’s going to go home. "Alice, this is a tough job." No, you want to make steel, and you want to dig coal, and that’s what you want to do. I was in West Virginia when Hillary made that terrible statement that she wants to close up all of the coal. She forgot in three weeks she was going to West Virginia. Remember, she wanted to close up all coal. She was in an area where they didn’t do the coal, and she said, "I look forward to closing up all coal. It’s going to be closed. Steel is going to be in big trouble." She forgot, three weeks she was going to West Virginia. That didn’t work out. I want that one by 42 points, 42 points, West Virginia.
I actually think this time we have a good chance of winning Virginia, which is a tough one to win, because you know you have some people there that maybe don’t agree with us, but I think we have a really good chance of Virginia, too, which is something that hasn’t been won by a Republican in a long time. But it’s common sense, and a lot of this is, you know, they say politics, politics, great politics is common sense. But on my first day in office, I ended the war on American energy, and that’s common sense, I think. That’s common sense. We’re lucky. You go to places like China, they don’t have oil and gas. They don’t have it under there. They have to go buy it, and then they devalue their currency and manipulate their currency, and that’s cost them a fortune to go out and buy it.
They hurt themselves in the long run, but they’re devaluing all over the place as others are. But we have this unbelievable, the greatest in the world. We have the greatest resources, which really came about over the last few years. Nobody knew this. Fracking made it possible. Other new technologies made it possible, and now we’re the number one. Think of it, as I said, the number one energy producer in the world. I’m so proud of that, because we wouldn’t have been number five. They were going to close it up. They were going to close it up, and it’s common sense. They wanted to take away our wealth. That’s what the Paris Accord would have done, would have taken away our wealth. It wasn’t for us. It was good for others. It wasn’t for us. We had to pay money to other countries that are very substantial countries. They wanted to take away your wealth. They didn’t want you to drill. They didn’t want you to frack. They didn’t want you to do steel. They wanted to take away your wealth. . Now the press will try and spin that differently, but I’m right.
The fake news. That’s a lot of people back there for, for 11 o’clock speeches. That’s a lot of people. It’s like the Academy Awards during the day. It used to be. The Academy Awards is on hard times now. You know that. Nobody wants to watch it. You know why? Because they started taking us on. Everyone got tired of it. It’s amazing. That used to be second after the Super Bowl, and then all of a sudden, now it’s just another show, because people got tired of people getting up and making fools of themselves and disrespecting the people in this room and the people that won the election in 2016.
And the people that won the Senate without me on the ticket in 2018, they never say that. We won the Senate. That’s why we’ll have appointed within two months 179 federal judges and two Supreme Court judges. Think of that. 179. But they don’t say we want the Senate. They say we lost the House, and you know, there are a lot of people running for the house. It’s hard for me to campaign, but almost everybody I campaigned for won. We had tremendous records in ’18, and I wasn’t running. There’s a big difference. In 2020 we’re running, so you better get out there and make sure we win.
We have a record that nobody’s ever had. Remember when I was running, I was saying, "We’re going to do this. We’re going to create jobs." Everyone, big yawn. You know, we like him. Let’s give him a shot. What do we have to lose, right? I said that with African Americans, they had the worst crime rates, the worst education, the worst everything. They had like 10 things. I’m reading it off a list. I looked, I said, "What the hell do you have to lose?" But I really sort of said the same thing to everybody, because our country wasn’t doing well with Biden and Obama, wasn’t doing well, and they were pouring money in, pouring, pouring money in, and it wasn’t doing well. Even now, you see the interest rates, I’m paying a normalized interest rate. We should be paying less, frankly.
This guy’s made a big mistake. He’s made a big mistake. The head of the Fed. That was another beauty that I chose, but even with that, we’re paying a normalized interest rate. The nice thing is you get some interest from the bank. With President Obama, he was paying nothing. It’s easy to make money when you’re paying nothing. You’re paying zero. Easy. But even with that, our economy’s roaring, and his wasn’t. It was the weakest economy since the Great Depression, the weakest up. So we have it going. Our country now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world.
Every time a prime minister, president, king, queen, dictator, whatever they may be. Some are sort of mutual. Some you have presidents and prime ministers who are actually dictators, but they come in and they see me at the Oval Office. They always say, almost everybody, congratulations on your incredible economy. What you’ve done is incredible. The tax cuts, the regulation cuts, all of the things we’ve done, and they’re all saying that they want to try and copy us. It’s not easy to copy us. A part of the reason it’s not easy is because of the people like this all over the country, the people in this room. You are incredible people. That was an incredible. Thank you.
Incredible people. Incredible people. And here in the Appalachian region where the Marcellus and Utica shale formations generate one third of American natural gas, think of that. You’ve been sitting on this for a long time, and yet look at the numbers. Look at the way you lived, because you never had anybody that wanted to take advantage of it, but now we’re taking advantage of it. You’re sitting on gold, and we’re taking advantage of it, and your future has never looked brighter or better. It’s so great that you stayed, because you suffered. This whole region, Appalachia. It just suffered, this whole region, with great people, the greatest people, and you suffered.
When this plant opens, 600 American workers will get the full time jobs with quality healthcare, pensions, and great pay to support a family, and you have, I said before, almost 2000 construction workers, and you’re going to another plant, because we’re going to talk to Bechtel after this, and we’re talking to Shell. When you got the boss from Shell, you people don’t realize, that’s a big deal. I don’t know where the hell he comes from. Where are you based? It’s not in this country. Hey, how about moving Shell to the United States?
We’re ready if you are. Just let me know. But they have their big USA division, but that that’s a great company. It’s a big deal, and that you’re here is a big deal. That’s a big deal to me, and it’s a big deal to everybody in this room. You have the top man, top man at Shell. But this is just the beginning. My administration is clearly the way for other massive multibillion dollar investments. We just did one in Louisiana. It’s a $10 billion plant. There’s more pipes in that plant that I’ve ever seen in my life. There’s more plant. You know that. LNG, it’s an LNG plant, $10 billion, and it’s totally sold out. They sell it like you rent office space. Can you believe it? It’s all sold out.
All over the world, people have used it, and you haven’t had a plant like that built in this country really ever, because there’s never been anything that big, but you didn’t build plants like that, because environmentally they weren’t letting you. And yet environmentally it’s so good what they’ve done and what they can build today. Investments that could bring more than 100,000 new jobs to this region are now being looked at very seriously, and I think the hundred thousand dollars, I really do, I feel the 100,000 jobs, Andrew, is going to be a very low number. I think you’re going to have many more. This is an incredible region. You’re sitting on top of something special. It’s all fueled by the greatest treasure on the planet, American energy, and we don’t want people taking that away from us. Two more companies have recently proposed a $10 billion investment in the great state of Ohio, incredible state.
We have tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investments, and this is really good stuff that we’re now negotiating, but these two are in Ohio. The energy revolution is also creating new jobs in West Virginia, Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, all across our beautiful land. You have no idea what’s going on, including, as I said before, car companies. We didn’t make cars. Look, we lost 32% of our car companies to Mexico, before I got there, by the way. Now it’s very, very hard to do that anymore. Nobody’s going to be looking that way, I don’t think. And I want to thank Mexico, because the president now has been great, and he’s got 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and on his border with Guatemala, keeping our borders safe. Our numbers are plummeting, the people coming in, all because the Democrats won’t approve fixing the loopholes of asylum. So I want to thank Mexico. It’s incredible. We have close-
I want to thank Mexico. It’s incredible. We have close to 27,000. Think of that. We never had three. I think we had about two and a half soldiers. One was sitting down all the time. We had nobody.
And don’t forget, the southern border is 2,000 miles from the Gulf to the Pacific. We have 27,000, and they’re doing a great job. They’re helping themselves, too, because they’re disrupting and really hurting the cartels. So much of that stuff is run illegally by the cartels, human trafficking, drugs, people. It’s terrible.
Mexico, I’ll tell you, they are so far I hope they’re going to keep it up. I hope they’re going to keep it up. But they’ve been great, and 27,000 people. They wouldn’t have done that for any other president. That I can tell you. That I can tell you.
With us today are a few of the hardworking Pennsylvania patriots who are making this comeback possible.
Jason Eckhart is the third generation of his family to work on these grounds, and he’s doing better than any of them. By the way, three years ago, you wouldn’t have said that. Three years ago, his father would say, "Hey, I had it made." His grandparents would say, "We had it made." Now he can look at them and say, "Dad, we have it made.".
His father and grandfather worked for the zinc smelting company previously housed at this site. When that plant closed in 2014, 500 jobs disappeared, like magic. Remember President Obama, "You need magic to bring back manufacturing jobs. You need a magic wand." Do you remember? "Not going to happen." Well, so far, we’ve brought back 600,000 manufacturing jobs.
Jason never imagined he would get the chance to carry on his family’s legacy, but now he has. He is carrying it on, and he’s carrying it on proudly. He’s a great American. Jason? Where are you, Jason? Jason? Jason? Come on up, Jason. Come on, let’s get Jason up. Come on up. Jason. I’d like Jason to tell us what this great facility means to him and to his family. Thank you.
Thank you, Jason.
Thank you, Jason. Great. Did you enjoy doing that, Jason? I think so. You had a big group of people back here that likes you a lot. They’re giving him a hard time back there, his friends. Thanks, Jason.
Heather Michaux grew up here in Beaver County, and has been working for Shell in other states for several years. Now she can raise her family right near her parents and loved ones, and actually be home, where she wants to be and where she belongs. Heather, please come up and tell us about your journey.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. She’ll be running for office soon. Fantastic job.
Samantha Polizotto was a single mom working full-time when she learned about process technology training programs at the local community college, funded by Shell. She became the first woman to graduate from that program, and she made the Dean’s List. That’s pretty good. Now she’s leading the way as one of the very first production operators hired here at Shell.
Samantha, please come up and say a few words. Please.
Thank you, Samantha. That was a great job. Thank you.
To help create more opportunities for workers like Jason, Heather, and Samantha, my administration started the Pledge to America’s Workers. Our partners are providing over 12 million training and enhanced career opportunities to American workers. My daughter Ivanka is working so hard on it. She’s done a great job. Twelve million people, so far, have been positively affected.
Today, I’m pleased to announce that Shell is signing the Pledge to America’s Workers to provide enhanced career opportunities. By the way, Shell, thank you. They’re providing career opportunities to 3,300 workers over five years, right here in Western Pennsylvania. That’s great. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. And thank you, Hilary, for the tremendous commitment that you’ve made. We really appreciate it. Fantastic job.
Under this administration, we live by two very simple words, Buy American. That’s what we want. I’m going to add something. Hire American. It’s about hiring American, buying American. It’s about America First. It’s about Make America Great Again. It’s about Keep America Great.
Despite all of this exceptional progress, however, some politicians in this country still want to keep America’s vast energy treasures buried deep underground, let other nations take advantage of our country. Not happening anymore. They see factories like this one not as a cause for celebration, but for condemnation. Democrats in Congress are pushing hard for the Green New Deal. How about that one? Green New Deal.
Boo.
Where it puts everybody in this room out of work, hate to tell you, and a lot more people. Everybody out of work. But I don’t want to speak badly about it. You know, you’ve heard me say this. I want to encourage them. That should be their platform.
I don’t want to do it too early. I did it very early with Pocahontas. I should have probably waited. She’s staging a comeback on Sleepy Joe. I don’t know who’s going to win, but we’ll have to hit Pocahontas very hard again if she does win. But she’s staging a little bit of a comeback. What a group, Pocahontas and Sleepy Joe. I don’t think they give a damn about Western Pennsylvania, do you?
No.
I don’t think so. And other radical plans to wipe out our coal. That’s what they want. They want to wipe out our oil. They want to wipe out our natural gas industries, while allowing other countries to steal our jobs. Virtually every leading Democrat has vowed to eliminate fossil fuels, obliterating millions of American jobs, devastating communities, and bankrupting factories, families, and senior citizens all across this region.
By the way, this is the only fuel that has the power for plants. When you have to steam up and you have to fuel up on these giant plants, these giant generators, these giant electrical factories, you need what you’re doing. You need this. It’s got the power. The other doesn’t have the power, certainly not yet, probably never will.
We’re not taking chances. We have the cleanest air and water we’ve ever had in our country right now, the cleanest we’ve ever had, and we’re going to keep it that way.
We’re never going to allow other countries and outside sources to take away our great wealth, because that’s what they want to do. They want to take away our wealth, take away our jobs. We’re not going to let it happen.
To see the destructive results of the far-left’s energy nightmare, just compare the enormous success here in Pennsylvania with the tremendous folly happening right across a line, a little line, in New York. Both states have vast energy reserves, but New York prohibits development while Pennsylvania welcomes it.
From 2010 to 2017, natural gas production plummeted by nearly 70% in New York, but it soared almost 1000% percent in Pennsylvania. And New York won’t allow us to build a pipeline across, because New York is sort of a long state, and we can’t have pipelines going across, helping a region that’s not a wealthy region at all. They have a lot of economic problems. People are leaving left and right.
We want to get it over to the waters. We want to get it over to the oceans. We want to get it up to New England, where they have the highest energy costs anywhere in the United States. We can’t get energy because New York doesn’t allow the pipelines to go through. That’s going to be very costly for New York, ultimately.
As a result, families in Pennsylvania shale country got more jobs, billions of dollars in royalty payments, and wages that are significantly higher compared to their neighbors just across the state line. Meanwhile, families in New York I love New York. that’s where I’m from. Probably most of you don’t know that. That’s where I’m from. They’re burdened with more power outages and electricity rates, you never saw anything like this, that are much, much higher than neighboring states and than your state.
New York energy rates are through the roof. New England, through the roof. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we can’t get pipelines through New York. New York won’t let us. They won’t let us.
All New York likes to do is sue me. They like to sue me. They’re always suing. I said, "Which lawyer is handling that case?" No, they sue me for everything so they can try to stop us by any means possible.
The radical Left wants to do to America what they’ve done to New York, raise prices, kill jobs, and leave our nation less independent and far less secure. My vision is the exact opposite. We want to work with New York, and we want to help New York. They need jobs in New York so badly. You know, they talk about the environment. So you have the state line, and over here you have machinery fracking. And over here you have nothing, except poverty. Over here you have people driving new cars and nice cars, and over here you have cars that are 40 years old. Now, what does that have to do with the environment? It’s the same. It’s an artificial line.
I wonder what happens when they get down there. What happens? I just wonder, is New York losing its wealth? You know what I’m talking about, right? What happens when those lines go down and they can go in any direction now? The equipment is so incredible.
Hopefully, we can help New York. I want to help New York so much. We will never allow ourselves to be at the mercy of foreign energy suppliers. That’s what’s fighting us. They don’t want us to have great energy. They’ve made a fortune selling us energy.
You probably saw the Straits the other day. Very few American boats are there. They capture. Iran, I broke up that deal. That was a good thing to do. It’s a whole different country right now.
They’re capturing boats from other countries. They’re not taking our boats. One of the things that was brought up by the media, actually, and wisely and correctly brought out, we have very few boats going there anymore because we have our own oil and gas. We don’t need it from the Middle East anymore. That’s why we’re pursuing a future not only of energy independence but not just words. You know, you’ve been hearing energy independence for years and years, and you’d hear it. We have real independence. But what we want now is not independence; we want American energy dominance. Dominance.
Instead of relying on foreign countries, we are now relying on American producers, and we are relying on American workers to build our own future right here on American soil. It’s time.
Together, we’re defending the oil and gas workers who light up our cities and uplift our communities. We’re fighting for the technicians and construction workers here in Beaver County who are building a powerful engine of American commerce. There’s no place like what you’re seeing right outside these doors. There is no place like it.
We’re here once again to stand up for the engineers and the factory workers who will shape the work of your hands into American-made products sold all over the world. That’s what’s going to happen. That’s what you’re producing.
And everyday patriots who make this all possible, you are the backbone of America, the absolute backbone, and you haven’t been given the honor of having that said by other people. But you are the backbone of this country. So true.
You are the ones who work hard, pay your taxes, build your neighborhoods, obey our laws, safeguard our values, raise up your children, make this land the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. You are the ones who do it. We work with a lot of people, but you are there and you are doing it. You’ve always been loyal to America, and now you finally have a president of the United States who is loyal to you.
Our vision is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, pro-energy, and 100% pro-American. We’re taking care of our military, and we’re taking care of our vets. Veterans Choice, you’ve been hearing it about for 45 years. I got it approved. Veterans Choice. We’re taking care of our veterans. We’re taking care of our military like never, ever before. Because Americans can do anything, go anywhere, and outperform anyone. Nobody can beat us. Nothing can stop us, because winning is what Americans do. Winning is what we know best. We will keep winning, wining, winning.
I used to tell you the story about winning. I used to say that your great leaders would come to Washington and they would say, "President, we’re winning too much. We can’t take it anymore. The people of Pennsylvania cannot stand winning. We haven’t won for years and years, and now we’re winning too much. Mr. President, please, for the good of the people of Pennsylvania, stop winning. Stop creating all these jobs. Stop creating all this product. Please, sir. Please, stop winning.".
I said to them, and I will say to them, "We’re never going to stop winning because nobody has ever won like what’s happened over the last couple of years. Nobody has ever won like you’re winning." I’ve more than fulfilled my promises. Even they said, "He promised things, and he actually produced more than he promised." That’s true. But we’re going to produce more and more.
I just want to thank everybody. With your help, factory floors across this land are once more crackling with life. Our steel mills are fired up and blazing bright. The assembly lines are roaring. Industry is booming. And the hearts of our workers, the American spirit, is soaring higher, stronger, freer, and greater than ever before.
I want to thank you all for giving this nation your very best, and your very best cannot be beaten. I want to thank you for filling America with pride. We are proud of you. We think you are just incredible, incredible people. It’s an honor for me to be with you in Pennsylvania.
Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless you.
(singing)
May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo, and may God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families. May God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Well, thank you very much. This is certainly being home for me. I spent a lot of time right here. I was in Queens, so I’d come here and this was like the luxury location for me and I love it. I love the people here. Even coming in from the airport, I sat with Nikki Haley, who’s here someplace. Where’s our Nikki? Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is so incredible. And she’s seen crowds in her life. And she said, "Boy. Those are really big crowds." Crowds of people all lining the streets all the way over to here and it’s really a special place. And so when I heard about this, I said, "I want to do that one." But I really wanted to do it, not because of location, but because, as you know, I am the big, big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement. Okay? From day one. From day one.
We love our police. We love our sheriffs and we love our ICE officers and they have been working hard. Thank you. They have been working hard
Together we’re going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities. And we’re going to destroy the vile criminal cartel, MS-13, and many other gangs But MS-13 is particularly violent. They don’t like shooting people because it’s too quick. It’s too fast. I was reading One of these animals was caught and explaining they liked to knife them and cut them and let them die slowly because that way it’s more painful and they enjoy watching that much more. These are animals.
We’re joined today by police and sheriffs from Suffolk, Nassau, Duchess and Ulster counties. State police from New York and New Jersey. Many of you I know. Great friends. Immigration and customs enforcement officers, and law enforcement personnel from a number of federal agencies, so we’re loaded up with great people. That’s what I call it. And I want to just tell you all together right now, and the reason I came This is the most important sentence to me. On behalf of the American people, I want to say, "Thank you. Thank you very much."
Thank you. And I don’t think you know how much the public respects and admires you. You’re saving American lives every day and we have your backs. Believe me. We have your backs 100%. Not like the old days. Not like the old days.
You know, when you want to take over used military equipment, they were saying you couldn’t do it, you know what I said. That was my first day. You can do it. In fact, that stuff is disappearing so fast we have none left. You guys know how to you You really knew how to get that, but that’s my honor. And I’ll tell you what, it’s being put to good use.
I especially want to thank ICE director, Tom Homan, who has done an incredible job in just a short period of time. Tom. Get up here. I know you’re just
Tom is determined to rid our nation of cartels and criminals who are preying on our citizens. And I can only say to Tom, "Keep up the great work." He’s a tough guy. He’s a tough cookie. Somebody said the other day They saw him on television. Somebody that were interviewed after that, they said, "He looks very nasty. He looks very mean." I said, "That’s what I’m looking for." That’s exactly what I was looking for.
And for that, I want to congratulate John Kelly, who has done an incredible job of Secretary of Homeland Security. Incredible. One of our real stars. Truly one of our stars. John Kelly is one of our great stars. You know, the borders down 78%. under past administrations, the border didn’t go down it went up. But if it went down 1%, it was like, this was a great thing. Down 78%. And, in fact, the Southern border of Mexico? We did them a big favor. Believe me. They get very little traffic in there anymore because they know they’re not going to get through the border to the United States. So, that whole group has been incredible. Led by General Kelly.
Let me also express our gratitude to the members of the New York delegation here today. Congressman Chris Collins. Where’s Chris? Where’s Chris? Oh. Chris. Right from the beginning, he said, "Trump is going to win." Trump is going to win. That’s why I like him. I didn’t like him that much before now. I love him. I’ll never Dan Donovan. Thanks, Dan. Thank you, Dan. And Lee Zeldin, who I supported right from the beginning when they said he didn’t have a chance of beating a pretty popular incumbent. And I saw him in a debate, I said, "I think this guy’s going to win." But he fought a pretty popular guy. And I said, "I think he’s going to win." And went heavy for him and he won. And he won pretty easily, didn’t you? Pretty good. I’m proud of you. Great job.
And, of course, a legend, somebody that we all know very well, sort of my neighbor because I consider him a neighbor, but he’s really a great and highly respected man in Washington, Congressman Peter King. Very respected guy. He is a respected man that people like to ask opinions of. I do. Congressman King and his colleagues know the terrible pain and violence MS-13 has inflicted upon this community and this country. And if you remember, just a little more than two years ago, when I came down the escalator with Melania and I made the speech. People coming into this country, everyone said, "What does he know? What’s he talking about?" And there was Bedlam. Remember Bedlam? And then about two months later, they said, "You know, he’s right." So I’m honored to have brought it to everybody’s attention, but the suffering and the pain that we were going through And now you can look at the numbers. It’s a whole different world. And it will get better and better and better because we’ve been able to start nipping it in the bud. We’ve nipped it in the bud. Let’s call it, "Start nipping it in the. In the bud."
And MS-13, the cartel, has spread gruesome bloodshed throughout the United States. We’ve gotten a lot of them out of here. Big, big percentage. But the rest of coming. They’ll be out of here quickly, right? Quickly. Good.
So, I asked Tom on the plane He was ever in Air Force One, I said, "How do you like it?" He said, "I like it." But I said, "Hey, Tom, let me ask you a question. How tough are these guys? MS-13?" He said-
Tom, let me ask you a question. How tough are these guys, MS-13? He said, "They’re nothing compared to my guys. Nothing." And that’s what you need. Sometimes that’s what you need. Right? For many years, they exploited America’s weak borders and lax immigration enforcement to bring drugs and violence to cities and towns all across America. They’re there right now because of weak political leadership, weak leadership, weak policing, and in many cases, because the police weren’t allowed to do their job. I’ve met police that are great police that aren’t allowed to do their job because they have a pathetic mayor, or a mayor doesn’t know what’s going on. Were you applauding for someone in particular? It’s sad. It’s sad. You look at what’s happening, it’s sad. But hopefully, certainly in the country, those days are over. You may have a little bit longer to wait. But from now on, we’re going to enforce our laws, protect our borders and support our police like our police have never been supported before. We’re going to support you like you’ve never been supported before.
Few communities have suffered worse at the hands of these MS-13 thugs than the people of Long Island. Hard to believe. I grew up on long Island. I didn’t know about this. I didn’t know about this. And then all of a sudden, this is like a new phenomena. Our hearts and our nation grieve for the victims and their families. Since January 16th, think of this, MS-13 gang members have brutally murdered 17 beautiful young lives in this area on Long Island alone. Think of it. They butchered those little girls. They kidnap, they extort, they rape and they rob. They prey on children. They shouldn’t be here. They stomp on their victims, they beat them with clubs, they slash them with machetes, and they stab them with knives. They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into blood stained killing fields. They’re animals.
We cannot tolerate as a society the spilling of innocent, young, wonderful, vibrant people, sons and daughters, even husbands and wives. We cannot accept this violence one day more. Can’t do it. And we’re not going to do it. Because of you, we’re not going to be able to do it. You’re not going to allow it to happen. And we’re backing you up 100%. Remember that, 100%.
It is the policy of this administration to dismantle, decimate, and eradicate MS-13 at every other  And I have to say, MS- 13, that’s a name. Rough groups, that’s fine. We’ve got a lot of others. And they were all let in here over a relatively short period of time. Not during my period of time, believe me, but we’re getting them out. They’re going to jails, and then they’re going back to their country. Or, they’re going back to their country, period.
One by one, we’re liberating our American towns. Can you believe that I’m saying that? I’m talking about liberating our towns. It’s like I’d see in a movie. They’re liberating the town, like in the old wild West, right? We’re liberating our towns. I never thought I’d be standing up here talking about liberating the towns on Long Island, where I grew up, but that’s what you’re doing. And I can tell you, I saw some photos where Tom’s guys, rough guys, they’re rough. I don’t want to be, I don’t want to, you know, say it because they’ll say that’s not politically correct. You’re not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work. We have to get  Just like they don’t want to have rich people at the head of Treasury. Okay?
Like, I want a rich guy at the head of Treasury, right? Right? Right? I want a rich guy at the head of Commerce, because we’ve been screwed so badly on trade deals, I want people that made a lot of money now to make a lot of money for our country. And by the way, as I was walking up, they just gave me the numbers. Our numbers just came out this morning. GDP is up double from what it was in the first quarter. 2.6%. We’re doing well. We’re doing really well. And we took off all those restrictions and some we’re statutorily stuck with for a little while. But eventually that statute comes up and we’re going to be able to cut a lot more. But we’ve sort of liberated the world of creating jobs, like you’re liberating us and the people that live in areas.
But I have to say, one by one, we are indeed freeing up these great American towns and cities that are under siege from gang violence. Look at Los Angeles. Look at what’s going on in Los Angeles. Look at Chicago. What is going on? Is anybody here from Chicago? We have to send some of you to Chicago, I think. What’s going on? I mean, you see what’s happening there? Do we agree? Is there something maybe  Is there something 
I have to tell you one Chicago story. So, Chicago is having this unbelievable violence. People being killed. Four, five, six in a weekend, and I’m saying what is going on? When I was running, we had motorcycle brigades take us to the planes and stuff. And one of the guys, really good, you could see a really respected officer, police officer. He was at the head. He was the boss. And you could see he was the boss. He actually talked like the boss, come on, get lined up, because I’d always take pictures with the police, because I did that. My guys said don’t do it. Don’t do it. Other candidates didn’t do it, that I was beating by 40 points. Can you believe it? But I did it. Maybe that’s why I was winning by 40 points, but other candidates wouldn’t do it. But I always took the pictures with the police.
But we’re in Chicago and we had massive motorcycle brigades. And you know, those people have to volunteer. I don’t know if you know that, but from what I understand they have to volunteer. And I had the biggest brigades. I had brigades sometimes with almost 300 motorcycles. Even I was impressed. I’d look ahead and it was nothing but motorcycles, because they’d volunteer from all of the various states. But this one guy was impressive. He was a rough cookie and really respected guy. I could see he was respected. And he’s like, "All right, come on, get over here, get over here. He’s got to get to work. Get over here." And I said, "So let me tell you, you’re from Chicago?" "Yes, sir." I said, "What the hell is going on?" And he said, "It’s a problem can be straightened out." I said, "ow long would it take you to straighten out this problem?" He said, "If he gave me the authority, couple of days. I really mean it." I said, "You really think so?" He said, "A couple of days. We know all the bad ones."
I said, you really think so? He said a couple of days. We know all the bad ones, we know them all. And he said, the office is you guys, you know all the bad ones in your area, you know them by their names. I said, we know them all. A couple of days. I said, you’ve got to be kidding. Now this is a year and a half ago. I said, give me your card. And he gave me a card and I sent it to the mayor. I said, you ought to try using this guy. Guess what happened? Never heard. And last week they had another record. It’s horrible, but we’re just getting started. We will restore law and order on Long Island. We’ll bring back justice to the United States. I’m very happy to have gotten a great justice of the United States Supreme court, not only nominated but approved. And by the way, your second amendment is safe.
Your second amendment is safe. I feel very good about that. Wasn’t looking so good for the second amendment. Was it? Huh? If Trump doesn’t win, your second amendment is gone. Your second amendment would be gone. But I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien that are threatening, so violently, our people. We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you and we will deport you. And we had some problems with certain countries, still do with a couple, but we’ll take care of them. Don’t worry about it. Anytime we have a trade deficit, it’s very easy, which is almost everywhere. We have trade deficits with almost every country, because we had a lot of really bad negotiators making deals with other countries. So it’s almost everywhere. So that takes care of itself. But we had certain countries in South America where they wouldn’t take the people back.
I said, that’s okay, no more trade. All of a sudden they started taking their people back. It’s amazing. Isn’t it? They used to send to the former secretary of state of the country, please call, would you please work it so that we could take? And they used to just tell her, no, we won’t take back. They take back with us every single time. We’re having very little problem. Are we having any problem right now with that? Huh? You better believe it. Give me the names of the few problems. We’ll take care of it, I’m telling you. It’s unbelievable. One of the people that represented the other administration, I said, why didn’t you use that? The power of economic? Sir, we think one thing has nothing to do with another. I said, oh, really? So we’ll have big deficits and they won’t take back these criminals that came from there and should be back there?
Well, believe me to me, everything matters, but they’re all taking them back. I saw offices recently conducted the largest crackdown on criminal gangs in the history of our country. In just six weeks, ICE and our law enforcement partners arrested nearly 1,400 suspects and sees more than 200 illegal firearms and some beauties and nearly 600 pounds of narcotics. The men and women of ICE are turning the tide in the battle against MS-13, but we need more resources from Congress and we’re getting them. Congress is actually opening up and really doing a job. They should have approved healthcare last night, but you can’t have everything. Boy, oh, boy. They’ve been working on that one for seven years. Can you believe that? The swamp, but we’ll get it done. We’re going to get it done. I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode.
Right now we have less than 6,000 enforcement and removal officers in ICE. This is not enough to protect a nation of more than 320 million people. It’s essential that Congress fund another 10,000 ICE officers, and we’re asking for that, so that we can eliminate MS-13 and root out the criminal cartels from our country. Now we’re getting them out anyway, but we would like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a patty wagon, you just see them thrown in rough. I said, please, don’t be too nice. Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, the way you put their hand over Like don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody. Don’t hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away. Okay? It’s essential that Congress fund hundreds more federal immigration judges and prosecutors. And we need them quickly.
If we’re going to dismantle these deadly networks and I have to tell you, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us because for years and years, they’ve been made to protect the criminal. Totally made to protect the criminal, not the offices. You do something wrong, you’re in more jeopardy than they are. These laws are stacked against you. We’re changing those laws. But in the meantime, we need judges for the simplest thing, things that you should be able to do without a judge, but we have to have those judges quickly. In the meantime, we’re trying to change the laws. We’re also working with chairman Bob Goodlatte on a series of enforcement measures, and he’s a terrific guy, to keep our country safe from crime and terrorism. And in particular, radical Islamic terrorism. A term never uttered by past administration, never uttered. Did anybody ever hear that term? I don’t think so.
But you heard it from me. That includes cracking down on sanctuary cities that defy federal law, shield visa overstays, and that release dangerous criminals back into the United States communities. That’s what’s happening. They’re releasing them so many deaths where they release somebody back into the community, and they know it’s going to end that way. That’s the sad They know it’s going to end that way. We’re ending those procedures. We have to secure Thank you. I spoke to parents, incredible parents. I got to know so many parents of children that were so horribly killed, burned to death, beaten to death, just the worst kind of death you can ever Stuffed in barrels. And the person that did it was released. And you would look at the file, and they were letter after letter, after letter of people begging not to let this animal back into society, that this would happen.
It would happen quickly. It wasn’t even like it would happen over a long period of time. They were saying it would happen quickly. It’s total violence. He’s a totally violent person. You cannot let this person out. They let the person out. And sometimes it would happen on the first day. And then you have to talk to the parents and hold the parents and hug them and they’re crying. I mean, crying, their lives are destroyed. And nobody thinks about those people. They don’t think about those people. They’re devastated, but we’re ending so much of that. We’re ending hopefully all of that. The laws are tough. The laws are stacked against us, but we’re ending them.
So we’re going to secure our border against illegal entry, and we will build the wall. That I can tell you. In fact last night, you don’t read about this too much, but it was approved, 1.6 billion for the phase one of the wall, which is not only design but the start of construction over a period of about two years, but the start of construction for a great border wall. And we’re going to build it. The wall is vital, and vital as a tool for ending the humanitarian disaster, really brought on by drug smugglers, and new words that we haven’t heard too much of human traffickers. This is a term that’s been going on from the beginning of time, and they say it’s worse now than it ever was. You go back a thousand years, when you think of human trafficking, you go back 500 years, 200 years, 100 years, human trafficking they say, think of it, what they do. Human trafficking is worse now maybe than it’s ever been in the history of this world.
We need a wall. We also need it though for the drugs, because the drugs aren’t going through walls very easily, especially the walls that I build. I’m a very good builder. You people know that better than most because you live in the area. That’s why I’m here. We’ll build a good wall. We’re going to build a real wall. We’re going to build a wall that works, and it’s going to have a huge impact on the inflow of drugs coming across. The wall is almost  that could be one of the main reasons you have to have it. It’s an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country.
The previous administration enacted an open door policy to illegal immigrants from Central America. Welcome in, come in please, please. As a result, MS-13 surge into the country and scoured and just absolutely destroyed so much in front of it. New arrivals came in and they were all made recruits of each other, and they fought with each other and then they fought outside of each other and it got worse and worse. We’ve turned that back. In the three years before I took office, more than 150,000 unaccompanied alien minors arrived at the border and were released all throughout our country into United States communities, at a tremendous monetary cost to local taxpayers, and also a great cost to life and safety. Nearly 4,000 from this wave were released into Suffolk County. Congratulations. Including seven who are now indicted for murder. You know about that. In Washington DC region, at least 42 alien minors from the border surge have been recently implicated in MS-13 related violence, including 19 charged in killings or attempted killings. You say, "What happened to the old days where people came into this country, they worked and they worked and they worked and they had families and they paid taxes and they did all sorts of things and their families got stronger and they were closely knit." We don’t see that. Failure to enforce our immigration laws had predictable results: drugs, gangs, and violence. But that’s all changing now. Under the Trump administration, America is once more a nation of laws and once again a nation that stands up for our law enforcement officers. We will defend our country, protect our communities and put the safety of the American people first. And I’m doing that with law enforcement and we’re doing that with trade and we’re doing that with so much else. It’s called America first. It’s called that expression I’m sure you’ve never heard of, make America great again. Has anybody heard that expression? Have you heard that? That is my promise to each of you. That is the oath I took as president. And that is my sacred pledge to the American people. Thank you everyone here today. You are really special, special Americans. And thank you in particular to the great police sheriffs and ICE officers. You do a spectacular job. The country loves you. The country respects you. You don’t hear it, but believe me, they respect you as much as they respect anything. There is the respect about our country. You are spectacular people.
Because of the danger of your job, which people also understand fully, I leave you with the following. Thank you and may God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Utah and Omaha beaches. Every coastguardsman is trusted to put service before all. Coasties plunge from helicopters and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save American lives. They secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists in rough seas at high speeds. Their sharpshooters take out smuggler’s engines with a single shot. They never miss. When the red racing stripes of a coast guard vessel break the horizon, when their chopper blades pierce the sky, those in distress know that the help is on their way and our enemies know their time has come.
These guardians of our waters stand: Semper Paratus. They are always ready. They are the United States Coast Guard. Representing the Coast Guard today, you will soon see an HH60 Jayhawk helicopter based at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater along with an HH65 Dolphin from Air Station Atlantic City and an HC144 Ocean Century from Air Station Miami.
Thank you. Thank you to the Coast Guard. On a cold December morning in 1903, a miracle occurred over the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina when two bicycle makers from Ohio defied gravity with a 12-horsepower engine, wings made of cotton and just a few dollars in their pockets. Just six years later, America was training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle. In World War I, our fly boys rushed the skies of Europe and aces like Eddie Rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels in the clouds. General Billy Mitchell saw the promise of this technology and risked court martial in his quest for an independent air force. He was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves and America stood in the way. We wouldn’t let it happen.
After Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his Raiders flew B-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve. And as President Roosevelt said, the Nazis built a fortress around Europe, but they forgot to put a roof on it. So we crushed them all from the air. 177 liberator bombers flew dangerously low through broad daylight without fighter protection to cripple the Nazi war machine. More than 300 airmEn gave their lives to destroy the enemy oil refineries and five pilots were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions in that single raid. It was airman, Chuck Yeager who first broke the sound barrier. It was airman like Gus Grissom and Buzz Aldrin, who traded their saber jets for rockets to the stars. And it is our incredible airmen today who wield the most powerful weapon systems on the planet Earth. For over 65 years, no enemy air force has managed to kill a single American soldier because the skies belong to the United States of America.
No enemy has attacked our people without being met by a roar of thunder. And the awesome might of those who bid farewell to Earth and soar into the wild blue yonder. They are the United States Air Force. Representing the Air Force, you will soon see beautiful brand new F-22 raptors from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. And one magnificent B-2 stealth bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
What a great country. In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men to sail eastward. Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy the world has ever seen. John Paul Jones, America’s first great naval hero, said "I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm’s way." He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns. When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared I have not yet begun to fight.
When our navy begins fighting, they finish the job. The war of 1812, Captain James Lawrence fell with his brothers on the USS Chesapeake. His dying command gained immortality. "Don’t give up the ship." In the battle of Mobile Bay, Admiral David Farragut lashed himself to the rigging of his flagship to see beyond the cannon smoke crying, "Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead." In World War II, it was aviators launched from the carrier Enterprise, Hornet, Yorktown, who filled the skies of Midway and turned the tide of the Pacific War. Nobody could beat us. Nobody could come close. On D-Day, CB engineers came ashore to destroy blockades and barriers making way for the invasion. Many lost their lives, but they took the German defenses with them and our men crushed upon the beaches like a mighty storm. From the naval demolition units of World War II arose a force that became famous in the Kang Delta. They don’t want to see our force again. The very best of the very best, the Navy Seals.
It was the Seals who delivered vengeance on the terrorists who planned the September 11th attack on our homeland. It was the Seals who stand ready to bring righteous retribution in mountain jungle desert to those who do us harm. America sailors are not born. They are forged by the sea. Their traditions are rich with the salt and blood of three centuries. When old Laurie crest the waves of foreign shores, every friend and every foe knows that justice sails those waters. It sails with the United States Navy. Representing our great Navy today will be two F-18 Super Hornets from Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, along with two F-35 Lightnings from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.
So great. In November of 1775, the Continental Congress created two battalions of a new kind of warrior. One who kept and would protect our ships and sailors and be at home, both ashore and in the mast with musket in hand. Their versatility was proven in the War of Independence when 234 continental marines conducted their first amphibious raid, capturing the British supply of gunpowder and cannons at Fort Nassau. Ever since, Marines have fought in every American war. Their legend has grown and grown and grown with each passing year. It was the Marines who won America’s first overseas battle, vanquishing Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli. Their high stiff collar, which shielded them from the pirate sword, earned them the immortal name Leatherneck. It was the Marines, who after two long days of battle, march through the halls of Montezuma. It was the Marines who took heavy casualties to kick the Kaiser’s troops out of Belleau Wood in World War One, earning the title Devil Dogs. And it was the Marines who raised the flag on the black sands of Iwo Jima. From the Chosin Reservoir to Kaesong, from Helmond to Baghdad, Marines have struck fear into the hearts of our enemies and put solace into the hearts of our friends. Marines always lead the way. After the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, which claimed the lives of 241 great US servicemen, Marine Sergeant Jeffery Nashton lay in bandages so badly wounded, barely alive. When the commandant of the Marine Corps came to visit his hospital, Sergeant Nashton had to feel for the general’s collar. He wanted to feel his four stars. He could not see and he could not speak. He signaled for pen and paper. And with shaking hand, he wrote two words: Semper Fi. That motto, Semper Fidelis, always faithful, burns in the soul of every Marine a sacred promise the core has kept since the birth of our country. They are the elite masters of air and land and sea on battlefields all across the globe. They are the United States 
All across the globe. They are the United States Marines.
Representing the Marine Corps today will be a brand new VH-92, soon to serve as Marine One, along with two V-22 Ospreys from the famed HMX-1 helicopter squadron at Quantico, the Night Hawks.

In June of 1775, the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York and named after the great George Washington, commander-in-chief. The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware, and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown.
Our army manned the ramparts. It took over the airports. It did everything it had to do. And at Fort McHenry, under the rockets’ red glare, it had nothing but victory. And when dawn came, their star-spangled banner waved defiant. At Shiloh, Antietam, and Gettysburg, our soldiers gave the last full measure of devotion for the true unity of our nation and the freedom of all Americans.
In the trenches of World War One, an army sergeant named Alvin York, faced an inferno of enemy fire and refused to retreat. He said, "I won’t leave. I won’t stop." He shot his rifle 18 times, killing 18 of the enemy. When they fixed bayonets and charged, he killed seven more. The entire German machine gun battalion surrendered because of one man, Alvin York.
A generation later, the Army returned to Europe and embarked upon a great crusade with knives and rifles in hand. The Rangers scaled the cliffs of Normandy. The 101st Airborne leapt into the danger from above, illuminated only by enemy flares, explosions, and burning aircraft. They threw back the Nazi Empire with lightning of their own from the turrets of Sherman tanks and the barrels of the M1 rifle. In the darkness of the Battle of the Bulge, with Nazis on every side, one soldier is reported to have said, "They’ve got us surrounded again, the poor bastards." Yes. Outnumbered, American warriors fought through the bunkers of Pork Chop Hill and held the line of civilization in Korea. In the elephant grass of Vietnam, the first cavalry made its stand amid a forest consumed in flame with enemies at every single turn. The army brought America’s righteous fury down to Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and cleared the bloodthirsty killers from their caves. They liberated Fallujah and Mosul and helped liberate and obliterate the ISIS caliphate just recently in Syria, 100% gone. Through centuries, our soldiers have always pointed toward home proclaiming, "This we’ll defend." They live by the creed of Douglas MacArthur. "In war, there is no substitute for victory." They are the greatest soldiers on Earth.

Nearly 250 years ago, a volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers, blacksmiths, merchants, and militiamen risked life and limb to secure American liberty and self-government. This evening, we have witnessed the noble might of the warriors who continue that legacy. They guard our birthright with vigilance and fierce devotion to the flag and to our great country. Now we must go forward as a nation with that same unity of purpose. As long as we stay true to our course, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.
Thank you. We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed a continent, harnessed science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens, because we will never forget that we are Americans, and the future belongs to us.
The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free. We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
From the banks of the Chesapeake to the cliffs of California, from the humming shores of the Great Lakes to the sand dunes of the Carolinas, from the fields of the heartland to the Everglades of Florida, the spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever.
So once more, to every citizen throughout our land, have a glorious Independence Day. Have a great Fourth of July. I want to thank the Army Band, the National Park Service, the Interior Department, the incredible pilots overhead, and those who are making possible the amazing fireworks display later this evening. Now as the band plays the Battle Hymn of the Republic, I invite the First Lady, Vice President and Mrs. Pence, the service secretaries, and military leaders to join me on stage for one more salute to America by the famous, incredible, talented Blue Angels. God Bless you, God bless the military, and God bless America. Happy Fourth of July.
